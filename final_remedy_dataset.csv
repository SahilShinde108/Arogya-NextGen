"Thirst, reduced urine output, weakness, nausea and vomiting, elevated body temperature, irritability, restlessness or apathy in the later stages, somnolence, seizures, epileptiform attacks, coma",Hypernatremia,"The treatment for hypernatremia involves primarily addressing the underlying cause. For dehydration, immediate water intake can correct hypernatremia. For hypernatremia caused by excessive water loss or sodium retention, different approaches are employed.
1. For hypernatremia due to excessive water loss, besides addressing the underlying cause, the main focus is on correcting dehydration. The volume of water loss can be calculated using the following formula:
For males: Water deficit = 0.6 × weight × [1 - (Normal serum Na+ concentration mmol/L) / (Patient's serum Na+ concentration)].
For females: Water deficit = 0.5 × weight × [1 - (Normal serum Na+ concentration mmol/L) / (Patient's serum Na+ concentration)].
The weight used in this formula refers to the patient's weight before the onset of illness. The calculated water deficit is an estimate and does not account for the deficit of isotonic fluid, the physiological requirement for daily fluid replenishment (approximately 1500ml per day), and ongoing losses.
If the patient's original weight is unknown, the required water volume can be calculated as follows:
For males: Required water volume = 4 × current weight × desired decrease in sodium concentration (mmol/L).
For females: Required water volume = 3 × current weight × desired decrease in sodium concentration (mmol/L).
2. Preferred solutions for fluid replenishment are isotonic saline and 5% glucose solution mixed in a 1/4:3/4 or 1:1 ratio. Upon entering the body, glucose is rapidly metabolized, resulting in a hypotonic solution. A solution of 0.45% saline or 5% glucose solution may also be used.
3. Routes of fluid administration include oral intake or through a nasogastric tube for patients unable to drink on their own, generally used for mild cases. This method is safe and reliable. For more severe symptoms, especially those with central nervous system manifestations, intravenous routes should be used. When administering intravenous fluids, it's important to control the infusion rate and closely monitor serum sodium concentration, aiming for a reduction in serum sodium concentration of no more than 0.5mmol/L per hour to prevent osmotic imbalance in brain cells causing cerebral edema.
4. For hypernatremia caused by sodium retention, the primary treatment is to eliminate excess sodium from the body. This can be achieved by administering 5% glucose solution and using diuretics to increase sodium excretion, such as furosemide (Lasix) or ethacrynic acid (Edecrin). These diuretics are more potent in promoting water excretion than sodium excretion, so fluid replenishment must accompany their use. In cases of renal failure, hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis may be employed, with dialysate containing high osmolarity glucose preferred. The rate of serum sodium reduction should also be monitored to avoid rapid decreases that could lead to cerebral edema."
"Cough, headache, fatigue, symptoms of upper respiratory tract catarrh, night sweats, low fever, bloody sputum, coughing up phlegm, lemon-yellow sputum, increased eosinophils, wheezing, pulmonary rales",Simple Pulmonary Eosinophilia,"The treatment options for Simple Pulmonary Eosinophilia include: spontaneous resolution without treatment, anthelmintic therapy for those with parasites. For patients with significant and recurrent symptoms, corticosteroids can be administered until symptoms are controlled and pulmonary shadows have resolved, after which the medication can be gradually discontinued. Cough suppressant and expectorant therapies may also be administered."
"Nipple itching, burning sensation, rough and thickened skin with flaking, erosion, exudation, and ulceration",Paget's Disease of the Breast,"What are the treatment options for Paget's Disease of the Breast? 

Treatment: 
Surgical resection is the preferred treatment for this condition. 
1. Surgical Treatment: The extent of surgical resection should be determined based on whether a lump can be palpated within the breast. If the lesion is confined to the nipple without any lump in the breast or significant enlargement of the axillary lymph nodes, total mastectomy can be performed. If axillary lymph nodes are enlarged, suggesting cancer metastasis, modified radical mastectomy is recommended. In cases where there is a lump in the breast, radical mastectomy or extended radical mastectomy should be carried out. 
2. Radiation Therapy: If the patient is unable to tolerate surgery for various reasons, X-ray radiation therapy may be employed. However, the efficacy is relatively poor. Given that Paget's disease of the breast may originate from the apocrine glands, deeper X-ray treatment (tissue half-value layer of 8-10 mm) should be used. For small area lesions, a single dose of 599 rad is administered; for large area lesions, a single dose of 200-300 rad, once per day, with a total dose of 5000-8000 rad. 
Prognosis: 
The survival rate for this disease is higher compared to general breast cancer. The main factors influencing prognosis are whether there are lumps within the breast and the presence of lymph node metastasis. Nance reported a 5-year survival rate of 94.1% in 53 cases without breast lumps, and 40.6% with breast lumps. Kister reported in 159 cases, among the 133 who underwent radical mastectomy, those without axillary lymph node metastasis had a 10-year survival rate of 79%; those with lymph node metastasis had a 10-year survival rate of 28% only. In summary, patients with disease confined to the nipple have a better prognosis, those with lumps within the breast have a poorer prognosis, and the prognosis is even worse for those with lymph node metastasis."
"Erythema, papules, and multiple scales",Psoriasis,"The treatment for Psoriasis includes various measures. Neurodermatitis, a localized neurofunctional dermatosis, also known as lichen simplex chronicus, is traditionally named 'bullous lichen' in Chinese medicine due to its prevalence on the neck, resembling the thick, tough skin of a bull's neck. As described in classical texts, psoriasis presents as lichenification of the skin, significant thickening and roughness, intense itching, a slow disease progression with frequent recurrences over many years, and a high likelihood of relapse after healing. 
Treatment methods include: 
Oral Treatment: 
1. High-dose oral Vitamin A, 100,000 to 300,000 IU per day, or isotretinoin, 1mg/kg/day. However, long-term use may lead to bone demineralization, hair loss, and other toxic symptoms. 
2. Oral administration of T90 psoriasis vaccine as directed by a physician, with dosage ranging from 1 to 6 pills daily based on the condition, showing significant effectiveness. 
Western Medicine Treatment: 
1. Antihistamines and sedatives can be selectively used, such as chlorphenamine, diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, diazepam, etc., to alleviate itching. Avoid prolonged or short-term high-dose topical corticosteroids. 
2. Intravenous medication involves 0.25% Procaine injection solution, 10-20ml mixed with 500mg of Vitamin C for IV injection; or procaine 4-6mg/kg in 0.1% saline solution combined with 500-1000mg of Vitamin C for IV infusion. Alternatively, 10ml of calcium gluconate 10% can be administered intravenously. 
3. For localized psoriasis, antipruritic and antibacterial medications can be applied. 
4. For severe cases that are resistant to treatment, further options may be considered. 
External Treatment Methods: 
1. Realgar powder topical application. 
2. Topical application of neurodermatitis medication. 
3. Plum blossom needle tapping on the affected area: once daily, 10 sessions per treatment course. 
4. Other topical medications include compound fluocinolone acetonide tincture, Skin Disease Ning, 105 black soybean distillate ointment, antipruritic alcohol, among others. 
5. Local block: 2ml of compound quinine injection mixed with 1% procaine 4–6ml for subcutaneous injection in the area (injections should not be too superficial to avoid skin necrosis), once a week, 10 sessions per course. Alternatively, 0.1% methylene blue 2ml mixed with 2% procaine 5-10ml for subcutaneous injection in the affected area, once a week. 
6. Radioisotope therapy: Applications of phosphorus-32 or strontium-90. 
7. Superficial X-ray therapy: Application of 29–43KV, 60–100R per session, once a week, 3-4 sessions per treatment course, not exceeding 2 courses per year."
"Nail blanching with slow color recovery upon light pressure, slight redness of fingertips, indented nails, flat nails, nail embedding into the flesh, formation of small grains on nails, pink coloration of the lunula on the ring finger, white nails, frostbite on nails, nail trauma, nails turning purplish-blue, thick and brittle nails with multiple cracks, and shriveled nails",Onychomycosis,"The treatment methods for onychomycosis, one of the most stubborn and difficult to cure dermatophyte infections, may include oral and topical medications, or nail avulsion surgery. Given that the growth rates of fingernails and toenails are different, with the complete replacement of a new nail requiring approximately 100 days for fingernails and about 300 days for toenails, patience is crucial in the treatment of onychomycosis.

1. Nail Avulsion Surgery: Suitable for isolated nail infections. Under local anesthesia, the infected nail is removed. This method has a large wound area, can lead to bleeding, and is prone to infection. Post-operative pain is common, and there's a high risk of reinfection. It is less commonly used in clinical practice nowadays. Patients with heart diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and other conditions are advised against surgery.

2. Oral Medications: Suitable for infections in multiple nails. For example, daily intake of Terbinafine 250mg tablets for 6-12 weeks; Itraconazole 400mg/day for 7 days, followed by a 21-day break for one cycle, continuing for 3-6 cycles; Fluconazole 150mg once to twice a week for more than 4 months. These treatments can cure over 80% of dermatophyte and fungal nail infections. However, due to the necessity for the medication to reach the part of the nail bed infested by the fungus, high dosages and long treatment durations are often required, with regular monitoring for adverse drug reactions.

3. Topical Treatment: Varies depending on the medicinal preparations, primarily involves topical application and occlusive dressing methods.

   (1) Use a nail file (avoid using blades by non-professionals to prevent bleeding and infection) to thin irregular bad nails every two days;

   (2) Apply 30% acetic acid topically or soak the infected nail in 10% acetic acid once daily, for 3-6 months or more. Thinning the infected nail before application improves treatment effectiveness. Protect the skin around the nail with a mild cream before applying the medication;

   (3) Apply antifungal topical agents such as Terbinafine solution, Amorolfine nail lacquer, or Ciclopirox olamine topical solution.

In summary, the treatment of onychomycosis requires unwavering perseverance. It is also crucial to proactively treat dermatophyte infections in other parts of the body and chronic systemic diseases to enhance the body's resistance. A focus on both treatment and prevention is essential for the complete cure of onychomycosis."
"Constipation, high fever, red and swollen breast with heat and pain, enlarged axillary lymph nodes, abscess",Mastitis,"What are the treatment options for mastitis? 
Precautions before treating mastitis include: 
[Prevention and Adjustment] 
1. Pay careful attention to breast hygiene during breastfeeding. Clean the nipples with warm boiled water to maintain cleanliness. 
2. In cases of breast trauma, nipple cracks, or purulent infections of the breast and other parts, immediate treatment should be sought. 
Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment Methods for Mastitis: 
Internal Treatment: 
(a) For rapid onset of disease characterized by skin redness over the breast, widespread swelling, unbearable pain, and deep-set hair follicles; accompanied by cold-induced fever, constipation with dark urine; tongue red, coating yellow, pulse rapid, the diagnosis is heat toxin accumulating rapidly, involving the liver and stomach meridians with damp-heat and external pathogenic factors intertwining, causing stagnation in local meridians and collaterals. Thus, skin redness and swelling, unbearable pain, and fever due to the robust pathogen; constipation with dark urine due to heat toxin injuring body fluid. Treatment principle: Clear heat and detoxify. Prescription: Modified Huanglian Jiedu Tang. For high fever, add Shigao (Gypsum) and Zhimu (Anemarrhena) to clear heat and detoxify; for constipation, add Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (Da Huang) and Mangxiao (Mirabilite) for purgation. 
(b) For severe toxic heat causing skin ulceration and necrosis of the breast, resulting in intensified pain and persistent high fever, thirst, constipation; with red tongue, yellow dry coating, rapid pulse. The diagnosis is extreme toxic heat causing the flesh to rot, evidencing black necrotic tissues; intense pain due to blocked qi and blood. The treatment principle is to purge fire and detoxify. Prescriptions: Combine Longdan Xiegan Tang with Huanglian Jiedu Tang with modifications. If the toxic heat attacks internally, leading to high fever and delirium, use Angong Niuhuang Wan or Zixue Dan to clear the heart and open the orifices. 
(c) For cases where the acute phase subsides with discharge of necrotic tissues, reduced swelling and pain, but with slow healing and pale granulation tissue, accompanied by fatigue, pale complexion; pale tongue, thin coating, weak and thin pulse. The condition is chronic toxic heat damaging qi and blood over time, leading to weak qi and blood and malnourishment. Treatment principle: Adjust qi and blood, while clearing residual pathogens. Prescription: Si Miao Tong Jia Jian. 
External Treatment Methods: Before ulceration, apply Yulu Cream topically, or use Kuaiyi Jinhuang San mixed with vinegar for application; for necrotic foul-smelling tissues, use Huangbai (Phellodendron) solution for wet dressing, or Qi San Dan Yulu Cream for covering. After necrotic tissue discharge, use Shengji San, Hongyou Gao for dressing. If there's localized necrosis without rupturing, soft to touch with a bumpy sensation, consider making a radial incision to drain pus, followed by Qi San Dan medicated thread for drainage, and cover with Yulu Cream. For established fistulas, follow the corresponding external treatment protocol for breast fistulas."
"Scales, pustules, itching, swelling, pain",Impetigo,"The treatment options for Impetigo include systemic administration of antibiotics and local application of 0.1% Isehanol (Rifnol) solution or 1% Neomycin solution for wet compresses. Corticosteroids are effective in controlling skin lesions. Eradicating the infection source, especially in individuals with positive skin allergic reactions to Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, is crucial for treatment success, necessitating systemic antibiotics use. Even in the absence of detectable infection sources or signs, systemic antibiotic therapy may still be considered. Commonly used antibiotics include Erythromycin, Roxithromycin, Clindamycin, Ciprofloxacin, Tetracycline, Cephalosporins, Sulfonamides, and Rifampin might be chosen. Prolonging the treatment duration is advised if pustules rapidly resolve after antibiotic use, to thoroughly address the infection source. Systemic corticosteroid use can temporarily diminish pustules but carries a high recurrence risk upon discontinuation, thus requires cautious use. Moreover, oral methoxypsoralen, intramuscular Zi-dan-xin injection, and other agents prove to be equally effective. For unruptured, dry-surfaced pustules, local application of methoxypsoralen solution or ointment followed by long-wave ultraviolet light exposure, and local corticosteroid use can temporarily reduce pustules. In cases of ruptured pustules with evident local maceration, options include wet compresses with 0.1% Isehanol, 1% Neomycin, or 0.05% Wash-must-win solution, as well as the application of antibiotic and corticosteroid combination formulations to prevent secondary bacterial infections. Traditional Chinese Medicine formulas such as Liang-Xue Xiao-Feng Tang, Xi-Jiao Di-Huang Tang combined with Xiao-Du Yin, and others, adjusted accordingly, are effective. Vein injections of Ligusticum wallichii extraction liquid or Sanchinoside injection liquid also show efficacy. Wet compresses of Qian-Li-Ming decoction, Sophora flavescens decoction, or the application of Lithospermum oil, Coptis oil, etc., facilitate pustule resolution. A paste made from 50 grams of male essence, 5 grams each of Sheng-Dan and Bing-Pian, and 2 grams of Berberine tablets, mixed into a fine powder with sesame oil, also yields good therapeutic results."
"History of elbow trauma, local pain, swelling, limited flexion and extension of the elbow, limited forearm rotation",Radial Head Fracture,"What are the treatment methods for radial head fractures?
    - Treatment:
        1. Type I fractures can be treated conservatively with a long arm cast splint, fixing the elbow joint at a 90° flexion position for 4 weeks.
        2. Type II fractures have various treatment methods due to differing opinions, which are roughly as follows:
            (1) Surgery is recommended for fracture fragments that constitute more than 1/4 of the radial head (Mason classification) or more than 2/3 (Radin classification).
            (2) Surgery is also recommended for fractures with more than 30° angulation or more than 3mm collapse.
            (3) For limited autonomous activity after 2 weeks (Charnley) or 8 weeks (Adler), radial head resection, AO small screw internal fixation for larger fracture fragments may yield good results.
        3. Type III fractures, in some cases where the radial head maintains its shape despite being comminuted, conservative treatment can be considered; otherwise, radial head resection is indicated. The timing for resection is debatable. Some advocate for resection 3 weeks post-injury, but most suggest within 24 hours post-injury. This is also indicated in cases of concomitant inferior radioulnar joint and medial collateral ligament injuries with Swanson's artificial radial head replacement.
        4. Type IV fractures, due to severe soft tissue injuries and a high probability of heterotopic ossification, the radial head should be resected within 24 hours or observed for 3-4 weeks, with resection if heterotopic ossification has not occurred.
    - Prognosis:
        The prognosis is generally good."
"Sudden fainting, pale complexion, cold limbs, and thready pulse close to extinction",Syncope,"Treatment options for syncope include blood-invigorating and qi-smoothing techniques for solid-type syncope, and nourishing blood and qi for deficient-type syncope. 

For solid-type syncope, the primary treatment involves using a modified Tongdu decoction (from 'Jingyue Quanshu' by Zhang Jiebin) with a prescription of 12g Angelicae Sinensis Radix, 12g Carthami Flos, 15g Crataegi Fructus, 12g Linderae Radix, 12g Aurantii Pericarpium, 9g Aucklandiae Radix, 10g Cyperi Rhizoma, 15g Uncariae Ramulus Cum Uncis, and 30g Margarita. This mixture should be decocted in water and taken orally. 

For deficient-type syncope, the treatment focuses on nourishing qi and blood. The primary formula is Ren Shen Yang Ying Tang (from 'Taiping Huimin Heji Jufang' by Chen Shihwen et al.) with adjustments. The prescription includes 12g Ginseng (separately decocted), 30g Astragali Radix, 10g Angelicae Sinensis Radix, 15g Rehmanniae Radix Preparata, 12g Paeoniae Radix Alba, and 9g Schisandrae Fructus, decocted in water and taken orally. For those with cold limbs and weak breathing following perspiration, 12g processed Aconiti Lateralis Radix Preparata and 10g Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens can be added. 

Additionally, proprietary Chinese medicines like Shenmai Injection or Shengmai Injection can be used, either 20ml mixed with 20ml of 25% glucose solution for intravenous injection every 10-15 minutes for 3-5 times or 50-100ml mixed with 250-500ml of 5% glucose solution or saline for continuous intravenous drip until improvement is noted."
"Papules, excessive follicular keratinization",Keratosis Pilaris,"Treatment options for Keratosis Pilaris include oral administration of vitamins A and E capsules, in conjunction with a compound vitamin B formulation. Topical applications of keratolytic agents such as 0.1% tretinoin cream, 3% salicylic acid ointment, and 20% urea cream can facilitate the dissolution of keratin. For patients prone to infection, the application of mupirocin ointment is advisable, and severe infections may necessitate systemic anti-infection therapy. The prognosis is generally good, with most cases naturally subsiding within several months without any subjective symptoms."
"Diplopia, facial paralysis, increased head size (in children), coughing, headache, vomiting, optic disc edema, changes in vision and visual field, epilepsy",Glioma,"What are the treatment options for glioma? 
(1) Surgical Treatment: The principle is to remove the tumor as much as possible while preserving neurological functions. Early-stage patients with small tumors should strive for complete resection. Superficial tumors can have the cortex incised around them, and white matter tumors should avoid important functional areas for cortical incisions. For larger tumors located in the frontal or anterior temporal lobes, lobectomy can be performed to remove the tumor. If the tumor in the frontal or temporal lobe is too extensive for complete resection, as much of the tumor should be removed as possible, and a decompression surgery can be performed on the pole to extend the recurrence time. 
Hemispherectomy may be considered for tumors involving more than two lobes of a cerebral hemisphere, causing hemiplegia but not invading the basal ganglia, thalamus, and the contralateral side. 
For tumors located in motor, speech areas without significant hemiplegia, or aphasia, it is important to preserve neurological functions and avoid severe sequelae while removing the tumor appropriately. Temporal muscle subfascial decompression or bone flap decompression can also be performed. Biopsy followed by decompression surgery is an option. For thalamic tumors causing obstruction of the third ventricle, shunting can be performed, otherwise decompression surgery is also an option. 
In critical conditions, dehydration medication should be administered for supratentorial tumors while exams and diagnosis should be promptly pursued, followed by surgical treatment. Posterior fossa tumors can have ventricular drainage surgery first, and after 2-3 days when the condition stabilizes, surgery can proceed. 
(2) Radiation Therapy: External radiation sources include high-voltage X-ray therapy machines, 60Co therapy machines, and electron accelerators. 
(3) Chemotherapy: Lipophilic chemotherapy drugs that can cross the blood-brain barrier are suitable for cerebral gliomas. During grades III to IV of astrocytoma, the blood-brain barrier is compromised due to edema, allowing hydrophilic macromolecular drugs to pass through. However, the destruction of the blood-brain barrier is not severe at the proliferative cell-dense area around the tumor, hence lipophilic drugs are still the preference. The current drugs of choice include Teniposide (VM26), CCNU (Lomustine), and MeCCNU, which show a broad anti-tumor spectrum, high lipophilicity, and can cross the blood-brain barrier. They are cell cycle-specific drugs that disrupt deoxyribonucleic acid and block at the G2 (post DNA synthesis) and M (mitosis) phases. The treatment tends to use combination chemotherapy based on the cell kinetics and the specificity of drugs on the cell cycle, using more than two drugs, or even multiple drugs combined to improve efficacy. Shanghai Zhang Tianxi's use of teniposide - CCNU sequential chemotherapy has shown significant efficacy and is recommended. 
(4) Immunotherapy: Immunotherapy is still in the experimental phase, and its efficacy is not yet certain, subject to further research. 
(5) Other Medications: For malignant gliomas, hormone therapy with dexamethasone is most effective. It can reduce brain edema and has an inhibitory effect on tumor cell growth. This can alleviate symptoms, followed by surgical treatment. 
For patients with epileptic seizures, antiepileptic drugs should be administered before and after surgery."
"headaches, blurred vision, tinnitus, hearing loss, numbness in limbs, fatigue, irritability, incoherent speech, sleep disorders, and memory decline",Cerebral Arteriosclerosis,"Treatment options for Cerebral Arteriosclerosis include:
1. For symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, memory decline, and lack of concentration, cerebroactive agents like Piracetam (Cerebrocome), Dihydroergotoxine Mesylate (Hydergine), Vitamin E, Amisulpride/Loxapine (Sulpiride), calcium channel blockers like Nimodipine, Flunarizine (Sibelium), vasodilators like Vinburnine, Ligustrazine, and Ginkgo biloba preparations can be used for symptomatic treatment. For patients with anxiety and depression, appropriate treatment should be given, and for sleep disorders, low-dose benzodiazepines can be used to improve brain function.
2. Patients with carotid atherosclerosis can opt for antiplatelet drugs, such as Aspirin, Clopidogrel, and Ticlopidine Hydrochloride. In cases where the carotid artery lumen stenosis is greater than 75%, carotid endarterectomy can be performed to prevent the formation of cerebral thrombosis."
"Erythema, crust formation, pustules, papules, pruritus, vesicles, or bullae lesions",Pyogenic Granuloma,"Treatment options for Pyogenic Granuloma include: 

1. Allopathic (Western) Medicine Treatment: 
   (1) Systemic treatment: For widespread skin lesions accompanied by fever or lymphadenitis, sulfonamide drugs or antibiotic preparations can be administered. 
   (2) Topical treatment: The principles of sterilization, anti-inflammation, itch relief, and drying are followed. For unruptured blisters, apply 1% camphor or a 10% sulfur-alum lotion several times a day. For ruptured blisters that have formed erosive areas or crusts, initially apply a 0.1% Rifamycin solution for wet dressing, followed by the topical application of 0.5% Neomycin ointment, Mupirocin ointment, Ciprofloxacin ointment, or a 2% Gentian violet solution. 

2. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Treatment: 
   (1) Internal treatment: Symptoms include pustules surrounded by inflammatory erythema, erosions and purulent crusts after rupture, possibly accompanied by fever, thirst, poor appetite, constipation, dark urine, a red tongue with a thin yellow coating, and a slippery rapid pulse. These symptoms are attributed to damp-heat in the lung and stomach, and external pathogenic toxins. 
      Treatment principle: Clear heat, detoxify, and promote diuresis. 
      Prescriptions: Dandelion (10g), Violae Herba (10g), Wild Chrysanthemum (10g), Honeysuckle (10g), Scutellaria baicalensis (10g), Rehmannia (10g), Alisma (10g), Talc (30g, wrapped for decoction), and Licorice (6g). 
   (2) External treatment: 
      ① Apply Golden Yellow Powder mixed with herbal tea externally to the affected area. 
      ② Decoct 30g of Portulaca oleracea and 30g of Sophora flavescens, and apply as a wet dressing to the affected area. 
      ③ Apply a lotion made from an equal mix of Rhubarb and Sulfur, known as 'Overturning Powder'."
"Palpitations, shortness of breath, dyspnea, dizziness, syncope, cough with sputum, hemoptysis, fever, anemia",Cardiac Myxoma,"What are the treatment modalities for Cardiac Myxoma? Due to the risk of sudden death associated with Cardiac Myxoma, early diagnosis and surgical resection of the cardiac tumor should be performed as soon as a diagnosis is confirmed, to yield significant therapeutic results. Treatment Principles include: 1. Strict bed rest; 2. In cases of heart failure, cardiac tonics and diuretics to improve cardiac function, and cardiac tumor resection surgery should be performed as soon as possible or on an emergency basis under hypothermia and extracorporeal circulation; 3. Before aortic clamping, avoid manipulating or probing the heart internally or externally; 4. Complete resection of the tumor stalk area, atrial septum, atrial wall, endocardium, and myocardium; if cardiac valves are invaded and cannot be repaired, valve replacement surgery should be conducted; for annular dilatation leading to insufficiency, annuloplasty should be performed; if the resection of the septum is extensive, patch repair is necessary. 5. The cardiac incision should be large to facilitate complete tumor resection; 6. After tumor resection, the cardiac chamber should be thoroughly washed to prevent residual tumor fragments. Indications and timing for surgery: Once Cardiac Myxoma is diagnosed, surgical resection should be arranged without exception as early as possible. Given that patients are often threatened by arterial embolism and/or sudden death, timely intervention is crucial. 1. For patients with solitary Cardiac Myxoma without systemic reactions, elective surgery should be scheduled without delay. 2. In cases of severe systemic reactions, rapid disease progression, and ominous signs, emergency surgery should follow after excluding non-Myxoma factors. 3. Repeated episodes of arterial embolism posing a threat to life warrant emergency surgery. 4. For persistent fever unresponsive to extensive antibiotic therapy, without ruling out fever from Myxoma itself, alongside continuing antibiotic use, emergency surgery should not be postponed. 5. For chronic heart failure presentation, weakness, orthopnea, hepatomegaly, ascites, lower extremity edema cases, after ruling out other factors, active heart failure control should be pursued before surgery when the condition stabilizes. Contraindications for Surgery: There are no absolute contraindications for Myxoma surgery except for: 1. Cachexia caused by malignancies other than the cardiac myxoma, where concurrent surgical removal is not feasible; 2. Uncontrolled disseminated tuberculosis infection; 3. End-stage cases nearing death, unable to withstand the burden of cardiopulmonary bypass surgery; 4. Uncontrolled severe pyogenic infections. 5. Coexistent complex congenital heart and/or lung vascular malformations not amenable to conventional surgical correction (heart or lung transplantation may be considered). Preoperative preparations: For uncomplicated cases, aside from standard elective surgery preparations, adequate rest is essential, avoiding excessive activity and sudden bodily movements. Emergent cases should follow emergency protocols. Key surgical treatments include: 1. During transportation of the patient to the operating room and throughout positioning for anesthesia, excessive and abrupt movements should be avoided. 2. Anesthesia should be administered as for critically ill patients, paying attention to heparin resistance. During extracorporeal circulation, both arterial and venous lines should be fitted with micron filters (40µ) to prevent micro-thrombi from entering the circulation. 3. Prevent formation of tumor emboli. Throughout the surgery, remain vigilant about the possibility of tumor debris dislodging and forming emboli. For example, when performing median sternotomy, avoid vigorous shaking; before circulation stoppage, do not manipulate or palpate the heart, nor perform digital intra-cardiac exploration; gentle handling during surgery; post-tumor excision, thoroughly rinse and aspirate the cardiac chamber; arterial and venous ports of the heart-lung machine should be fitted with micron filters. 4. Choose an appropriate cardiac incision to fully expose the tumor (or its stalk). For different cardiac chambers' myxomas, especially large tumors or those located in unusual positions (or pedunculated), or multiple myxomas, different cardiac incisions are required to fully expose the tumor, the stalk, using a large enough incision. 5. Complete resection, ensuring the tumor is wholly removed. Along with parts of normal myocardium, completely excise the tumor without leaving any remnants. 6. Pay attention to protecting the myocardium to maintain normal cardiac function, ensuring smooth recovery. 7. Correct blood abnormalities. Cardiac Myxomas often present with blood abnormalities (anemia, acid-base imbalance, electrolyte disorders, heparin resistance); intra-operative adjustments should be made to achieve or approximate normal state, ensuring stable post-operative recovery. Post-operative care: Besides general post-cardiac surgery care, special attention should be paid to the signs of tumor emboli. In cases of limb embolization, active embolectomy is required; for cerebral embolism, symptomatic and supportive treatment should be pursued. Management of low cardiac output syndrome follows the routine post-cardiac surgery protocol, which includes replenishing blood volume, using cardiotonic and diuretic medications, adjusting blood pressure as necessary, and early installation of intra-aortic balloon pump or left/right ventricular assist device if required. Arrhythmias should be managed by correcting electrolyte imbalances and using appropriate anti-arrhythmic medications, installing temporary or permanent pacemakers as needed. Post-operative outcomes and follow-up requirements: Providing discharge instructions for patients is crucial to enhance their ability to self-monitor their condition, ensuring follow-up requirements are met to promptly detect recurrences. In China, follow-up data of over ten years indicate a recurrence rate of about 1% to 2%, whereas international literature estimates around 5%. This potential threat of post-operative recurrence necessitates long-term (lifetime) regular follow-ups. Follow-up content mainly includes self-monitoring (symptoms) and physical signs, with echocardiography being the most critical. It's recommended to have follow-ups every six months within the first four years after surgery and annually thereafter. Follow-up mode: Where possible, returning to the surgical hospital for outpatient review, or notifying the surgical hospital via communication after local hospital review. Medication Principles: Heparin and Protease for extracorporeal circulation, Protamine sulfate postoperatively to neutralize heparin. Postoperatively, Penicillin, Gentamicin for prophylactic or therapeutic antibiotic treatment, if ineffective, cephalosporin antibiotics may be used based on the condition. Postoperatively, according to the condition, use vasopressors or vasodilators. Postoperatively, cardiotonics and diuretics. Depending on the condition, postoperative continuous infusion of GIK solution."
"Joint pain, joint swelling, joint dislocation",Osteoarthritis,"What are the treatment options for Osteoarthritis?
    Osteoarthritis, when affecting the whole body or a few joints, is considered a benign disease. Most degenerative joint diseases involve multiple joints, gradually worsening, and are relatively non-disabling diseases. Patients often seek medical advice due to systemic joint pain, stiffness, or acute pain attacks in single joints. Non-surgical treatment aims to halt disease progression, alleviate joint pain and stiffness, prevent joint deformity, and improve joint movement and stability.
    For individual cases of osteoarthritis, where it's a progressive disease affecting a single joint, causing significant pain, restricted movement, joint deformity, and intra-articular disorder, surgical treatment is necessary."
"Cough, dry cough, headache, myalgia, hydrocephalus, meningitis, heart failure, axillary lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, strabismus, insomnia, nodules",Pneumocystis Pneumonia,"The treatment for Pneumocystis Pneumonia involves the use of Pyrimethamine and Sulfadiazine, both of which interfere with folic acid metabolism within the parasite, thereby inhibiting the division and reproduction of the trophozoite. These medications are ineffective against cysts. Both drugs can cross the blood-brain barrier, thus they are effective against both latent and symptomatic toxoplasmic meningitis. They are commonly used together but can also be used separately. The dosage of Pyrimethamine is 75mg per day, divided into two oral doses for the first two days, followed by 25mg per day. For infants and young children, the treatment is 1mg/kg per day for the first 1-3 days, followed by 0.5mg/kg per day. This medication has a teratogenic effect and is therefore contraindicated in pregnant women, especially during the early stages of pregnancy. The dosage of Sulfadiazine is 4g per day, divided into four oral doses, with children taking 100-150mg/kg per day, also in four divided doses. The treatment course for both medications lasts one month. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (Fansidar) is also an option. Spiramycin and Clindamycin can be used alone or in combination with Pyrimethamine or Sulfadiazine."
"Fever, chills, eschars or ulcers at the bite site, headache, generalized myalgia, fatigue, facial flushing, and red papular rash",Scrub Typhus,"The treatment for Scrub Typhus includes supportive care and specific antimicrobial therapy. Supportive care involves bed rest, consumption of easily digestible foods, enhanced nursing care focusing on oral hygiene and regular position changes. Ensure adequate hydration with increased fluid intake. For high fever, physical cooling methods such as ice packs or alcohol baths can be utilized, and antipyretics may be administered with caution to avoid excessive sweating. Sedatives might be employed to manage restlessness. For etiological treatment, Chloramphenicol is highly effective, with body temperature typically normalizing within 1 to 3 days. The dosage is 2g/day for adults and 25-40mg/kg/day for children, divided into four doses. For those unable to take oral medication, intravenous administration is an option. After the fever subsides, the dosage should be halved and continued for 7-10 days. Tetracyclines also yield satisfactory results; Doxycycline is recommended at a dosage of 0.2g once per day for adults, continued for 5-7 days. Other alternatives include clarithromycin, azithromycin, and erythromycin, which also show effectiveness. For children who should not receive tetracyclines, these alternatives can be considered. The dosage for clarithromycin is 0.6g/day for adults and 2-3mg/kg/day for children, divided into two doses, with the dosage halved after the fever subsides and continued for a 10-day course."
"Difficulty in sexual intercourse, glans itching, prepuce adhesion",Phimosis,"What are the treatment options for phimosis? 
    Patients with phimosis should undergo circumcision as early as possible. For cases of phimosis without inflammation, regular retraction and cleaning of the foreskin may be sufficient, eliminating the need for surgery. Circumcision is recommended before marriage for those with phimosis and elongated prepuce. After the treatment, sexual activities can be initiated. For those who have not undergone this treatment and engage in sexual intercourse, it is essential to clean the penile area before and after sex; additionally, maintaining lubrication in the genital region is crucial. During intercourse, avoid vigorous movements to prevent paraphimosis or frenulum tear."
"Diarrhea, mucous stools, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, purulent bloody stool, loss of appetite, high fever, low-grade fever, alternating diarrhea and constipation, fever, nausea and vomiting",Trichuriasis,"For the treatment of trichuriasis, the first-line pharmacotherapy is Metronidazole, administered orally in three or four divided doses for children, over a course of 5 to 7 days, achieving an immediate cure rate of 100%, and a near-term efficacy of 95%. Additionally, Tinidazole or a single dose of Ornidazole can be used. Secnidazole, a new medication, also displays good efficacy when taken in a single dose."
"Cyanosis of lips, nails, tip of the nose, earlobes, and oral mucosa due to rich capillary areas, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing",Tetralogy of Fallot,"Treatment for Tetralogy of Fallot primarily involves surgical intervention to increase pulmonary blood flow and correct congenital heart defects, thus improving oxygenation levels. Over 40 years ago, the surgical approach to treat Tetralogy of Fallot was to perform shunt operations between the systemic and pulmonary circulation to alleviate hypoxemia, enhance symptoms, and extend lifespan. With the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass for open-heart surgery, corrective surgery gradually replaced palliative shunt operations, showing increasingly better outcomes. There is, however, some disagreement on the timing of complete repair, particularly in infants and young children, with some advocating for early complete repair irrespective of age to avoid the risks of multiple surgeries and others suggesting staged surgeries due to high mortality rates associated with immediate repair in neonates which significantly decrease with age. At present, the surgical strategy is tailored based on the patient's age and the anatomical features of the defect. For infants with severe conditions needing immediate intervention, a preliminary palliative shunt operation might be performed, followed by definitive surgery after 6 months of age. Procedures such as the Blalock-Taussig shunt, Potts shunt, and Waterston shunt have been historically employed to improve pulmonary blood flow, each with its respective indications, advantages, and limitations. Recent advancements have significantly lowered mortality rates and improved outcomes, leading to more nuanced decision-making regarding the optimal timing and type of surgical intervention. Postoperative care is critical and includes monitoring for complications like bleeding, heart block, low cardiac output syndrome, heart failure, and respiratory failure. The management approach may also involve diuretics, digitalis, antibiotics, and medications to support blood coagulation, along with ensuring respiratory tract patency."
"lack of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, constipation, bruxism, edema, intestinal mucosal shedding, necrotic ulcers on the intestinal mucosa, weight loss, anemia, severe pain",Gnathostomiasis,"The treatment for gnathostomiasis involves various approaches. For severe cases, initial management focuses on robust supportive care aimed at improving nutritional status and correcting anemia. Antiparasitic treatment is considered once physical and mental health have been sufficiently restored, being careful to manage the dosage carefully. 

1. Dichlorophen: This agent exhibits significant lethal effects against lung fluke metacercariae and is clinically used for treating diseases such as lung fluke disease, beef tapeworm disease, and gnathostomiasis. 

2. Niridazole: This product, originally developed in China as a non-antimonial oral medication for schistosomiasis, is primarily absorbed through the small intestine. It significantly impacts the sugar metabolism of schistosomes by inhibiting glycolysis, thus blocking the energy supply to the parasites, causing paralysis and directly killing them. It is applied in the clinical treatment of schistosomiasis, gnathostomiasis, and clonorchiasis. 

3. Praziquantel: This is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic medication suitable for various diseases including schistosomiasis, clonorchiasis, lung fluke disease, gnathostomiasis, tapeworm infections, and cysticercosis. Adverse reactions include common side effects such as dizziness, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and muscle soreness, which are generally mild, short-lived, and do not interfere with treatment. A few cases may experience palpitations, chest tightness, and changes in their ECG, such as T-wave alterations and premature contractions, with rare instances of supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. Transient increases in transaminases and rare instances of psychiatric disorders or gastrointestinal hemorrhage have been reported. 

4. Thiabendazole: This broad-spectrum antihelminthic is effective against infections by roundworms, hookworms, whipworms, threadworms, pinworms, and cutaneous and visceral larva migrans (larval stage infections). It is notably effective against threadworms and is the drug of choice for strongyloidiasis. It is primarily used for treating strongyloidiasis and cutaneous and visceral larva migrans. 

5. Areca nut: This is one of the earliest treatments for gnathostomiasis in traditional Chinese medicine. Areca nut contains arecoline, which can paralyze the nervous system of the Gnathostoma worm and enhance intestinal motility, thus exhibiting vermifugal properties. Various methods utilize areca nut to treat gnathostomiasis."
"Fever, pain, swelling",Erysipelas,"The treatment of erysipelas focuses on clearing heat and dampness, nourishing the ying, and detoxifying.

For cold-damp syndrome characterized by diffuse swelling in the hip area, unchanged or pale skin color, local mild heat, incapacity to straighten the affected limb, fear of cold, worse pain at night, pale tongue with white coating, and a deep and fine pulse."
"Jaundice, oliguria, edema, hypertension",Hepatorenal Syndrome,"The treatment methods for Hepatorenal Syndrome include: 
1. Treatment of the primary disease: Since renal failure in this condition is functional, actively improving liver function can significantly enhance renal function. Surgical interventions, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and interventional treatments targeting liver tumors and cirrhosis should be pursued when possible. 
2. Supportive therapy: Discontinue any drugs that induce azotemia and damage the liver. Provide a low-protein, high-carbohydrate diet to reduce the development of azotemia and hepatic encephalopathy, while using hepatoprotective and enzyme-lowering medications. 
3. Removal of triggers: Common triggers for Hepatorenal Syndrome include upper gastrointestinal bleeding, liver cancer rupture bleeding, large-volume ascites drainage, high-dose diuretics, severe infections, and surgery, which should be timely prevented and treated. 
4. Correction of electrolyte and acid-base balance: Increase urine output and sodium elimination based on replenishing effective blood volume, and actively correct imbalances in K+, Na+, Cl+, Mg+, and acid-base. 
5. Volume expansion treatment: Use plasma expanders such as plasma, whole blood, albumin, or dextran in conjunction with diuretics like Mannitol to reduce vascular resistance and improve renal blood flow. Volume expansion should not be performed if pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is normal. 
6. Application of vasopressor drugs: Use of dopamine, phenylephrine, etc., can dilate renal blood vessels, improve renal blood flow, and decrease renal vascular resistance. 
7. Prostaglandins PI and 654-2: They have a protective effect on the kidneys. 
8. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment: Intravenous drip of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) injection can treat functional renal failure and lower BUN levels."
"Flushed complexion, fever, abdominal tenderness",Ascites,"The treatment options for ascites vary greatly due to the diverse causes that can lead to both exudative and transudative ascites, making it crucial to promptly identify the nature of the ascites and actively search for its cause. The reduction or resolution of ascites is possible only through etiology-directed treatment. In cases where the cause remains unclear, symptomatic treatment (including relieving symptoms such as abdominal distension and restricted breathing caused by a large amount of ascites) is necessary to alleviate discomfort. Furthermore, for ascites caused by conditions like advanced cirrhosis, severe liver impairment, or connective tissue diseases, even after cause-specific treatments have been administered, the ascites often cannot be fully resolved, sometimes even becoming refractory. In such cases, a comprehensive approach to treatment is required. Generally, the following measures can be adopted for treating ascites: 
1. Restricting intake of water and sodium, especially important in cases caused by hypoproteinemia, involves strict control over sodium intake, followed by water intake; a diet high in carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, and low in fats is recommended; a low-salt diet is also suitable for all patients with exudative or transudative ascites, aiming to excrete as much excess water as possible through the kidneys. 
2. Use of diuretics to accelerate the excretion of water through the kidneys. Typically, potassium-sparing and potassium-depleting diuretics are used in combination, or diuretics acting on different parts of the kidneys are combined to maximize the diuretic effect without causing electrolyte imbalances (especially avoiding increased or decreased serum potassium levels). The type and dosage of diuretics should follow the principle of individualization according to the person, the amount of ascites, and the underlying disease, starting with a low dose and gradually increasing as necessary. 
3. Supplementing albumin or enhancing protein synthesis, as in cases mainly caused by hypoproteinemia leading to a reduced plasma colloid osmotic pressure, involves dietary protein intake as well as appropriate intravenous albumin supplementation to raise plasma colloid osmotic pressure. After albumin infusion, the diuretic effect of diuretic medications can be enhanced, leading to a significant increase in urine output. Recent studies have found that recombinant human growth hormone (Somatropin) can be used to treat ascites resulting from liver disease-related hypoproteinemia by promoting hepatic protein synthesis and increasing serum albumin levels. 
4. Paracentesis is conducted when a large amount of ascites affects the patient's respiration or the abdominal distension symptoms are severe and unbearable, to alleviate symptoms. The amount of ascites removed per session should be between 1000-3000ml; after draining, injecting dopamine 20mg into the abdominal cavity can enhance the diuretic effect. However, frequent and large-volume paracentesis should be avoided due to the risks of protein and electrolyte loss, and increased chance of ascites infection. 
5. Ascites concentration reinfusion, ascites jugular vein return, or Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS): For ascites caused by decompensated liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, or hypoproteinemia, treatment can include ascites concentration reinfusion, which involves ultrafiltration of ascites and reinfusion of proteins, electrolytes, and other substances through the jugular vein. Ascites jugular vein return involves inserting a silicone tube from the abdominal cavity along the abdominal wall and thorax into the jugular vein for drainage. The TIPS procedure effectively reduces portal venous pressure and ascites but has been less commonly used in recent years due to the risk of irreversible hepatorenal syndrome complications. 
6. Use of vasodilator drugs when the ascites is exudative, in large volume, and diuretics are less effective, to improve renal blood flow. Drugs such as intravenous Tetrandrine 100-150mg daily or dopamine 20-40mg can enhance the diuretic effect."
"Intellectual impairment, confusion, inability to take care of oneself",Intellectual Disability,"What are the treatment options for intellectual disability? Children with marked intellectual impairment are often easily identified during infancy, yet mild intellectual disabilities may not be recognized until academic difficulties arise in elementary school. Early signs warranting further examination include delayed motor development, slow reaction to environmental stimuli, poor language development, and rigid facial expressions or unique facial appearances. It's crucial to seek medical evaluation as early as possible for timely diagnosis and treatment. 
In cases of congenital metabolic disorders such as phenylketonuria, homocystinuria, maple syrup urine disease, histidinemia, galactosemia, and congenital hypothyroidism (cretinism), early diagnosis and treatment can prevent intellectual damage or control the condition in most infants. For phenylketonuria and cretinism, if diagnosed and treated within the first three months post-birth, normal intellectual development is mostly achievable. Treatment post-six months often results in inevitable intellectual impairment. Moreover, initiating treatment between the ages of 3 and 4 years old complicates physical development. Early symptoms of cretinism and phenylketonuria are atypical and difficult to detect, usually identified months after birth when treatment becomes challenging, and the intellectual disability severe. Hence, many countries conduct newborn screening for these genetic conditions."
"Edema, erythema, exudation, purulent secretions, itching of the glans, balano-preputial swelling",Balanoposthitis,"Treatment options for balanoposthitis include: 
Western Medicine: 
1. Medication 
(a) Topical medications are selected based on the causative factors for those with a clear etiology. Medications that facilitate the reduction of swelling and promote tissue regeneration may also be considered. 
(i) 1% to 3% Clotrimazole cream or 1:500,000 units of nystatin ointment, for patients with local Candida infections. 
(ii) Antibiotic ointments like erythromycin, tetracycline, and aureomycin are applied topically to treat local bacterial infections. 
(iii) 0.1% Rivanol solution or 5% Resorcinol solution applied bid for wet dressing. 
(iv) Potassium permanganate solution (1:5000 to 1:8000) for local soaking (carefully flip the foreskin to expose the skin and mucous membrane as much as possible, avoid causing paraphimosis, clean the area with the solution and apply external treatment before repositioning the foreskin). 
(v) Compound cod liver oil ointment, ulcer oil, and others applied to the ulcer surface, once or twice a day. 
(b) Systemic medication involves the prudent use of antimicrobial or antifungal agents such as erythromycin, penicillin, cefoxitin, gentamicin, amikacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, nystatin, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, etc. The choice of drugs, route of administration (oral, IM, IV), and dosage should be determined based on the individual's specific condition. 
2. Surgical treatment may be necessary if balanoposthitis is accompanied by phimosis or excess foreskin, with circumcision performed after acute inflammation is controlled. For those with meatal stenosis, meatoplasty is recommended. 
3. Suspension of the penis with a gauze band tied around the waist may reduce local friction and is suitable for patients with significant swelling and pain. 
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM): 
Clinical treatment often adopts methods to dispel wind and dampness, clear heat and reduce swelling, or strengthen the spleen and remove turbidity. Commonly used herbs include Fang Feng, Chan Tui, Long Dan Cao, Chuan Niu Xi, Ku Shen, Di Fu Zi, Sheng Di Huang, Mu Tong, Jin Yin Hua, Lian Qiao, Huang Qi, Chen Pi, Bai Yao, and Bai Ji etc. Treatment is tailored based on the severity and stage of the disease (erythema stage, exudative stage, ulcerative stage). 
In addition, external treatments from both TCM and medicinal baths or washes adapted to specific symptoms are also considered as part of the comprehensive treatment strategy. 
Generally, balanoposthitis can gradually improve with various treatments from both Western and Chinese medicine. A good prognosis is expected. However, prolonged use of bitter and cold medicines to detoxify and reduce fire can damage the spleen and stomach, impeding disease management and possibly leading to protracted recovery. Hence, such medications should not be heavily relied upon or used extensively. Additionally, attention should be given to regulating the spleen and stomach functions. For those with phimosis or excessively long foreskin, surgical intervention is advisable to prevent recurrent infections. If the disease persists and does not respond to prolonged treatment, the possibility of penile cancer should be considered."
"Unilateral or bilateral palpable breast tissue, presenting as disc-shaped nodules or diffuse enlargement",Gynecomastia,"Treatments for gynecomastia include: 
1. Testosterone undecanoate 200mg, administered intramuscularly every 3–4 weeks. 
2. Tamoxifen (Triphenylethylene) acts by binding to estrogen receptors in target tissues, thereby blocking the action of estrogen. 
3. Clomiphene has a mechanism of action similar to tamoxifen (Triphenylethylene). 
4. Testolactone inhibits aromatase, preventing the peripheral conversion of testosterone to E2 (Estradiol). 
5. Mammoplasty: For irreversible gynecomastia that has persisted over time, mammoplasty remains an important treatment method. This generally involves the excision of the subareolar breast tissue through a periareolar approach."
"Loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, upper abdominal pain, creeping eruption, headache, abdominal pain, edema, pain, severe pain, abscess, dull pain, distension pain",Gnathostomiasis,"What are the treatment methods for Gnathostomiasis? 
1. Supportive and symptomatic treatment 
For severe cases, such as cerebral gnathostomiasis, when intracranial pressure increases, rapid intravenous infusion of 20% mannitol should be administered promptly, along with furosemide and corticosteroids if necessary to reduce intracranial pressure and prevent herniation. 
2. Etiological treatment 
Albendazole is effective in treatment. The oral course lasts for 3 weeks. In the 2nd week of treatment, Gnathostoma spinigerum larvae become stimulated by the medication and may struggle and sometimes burrow out of the skin, but this can also potentially worsen the condition. Usually, one course of treatment is enough for cure. In some cases, two courses may be necessary. After healing, the eosinophil count in the blood gradually returns to normal. 
Mebendazole, levamisole, and thiabendazole are less effective against this disease. 
Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic medication that is more potent against Ascaris, Trichuris, Ancylostoma, Brugia malayi, Wuchereria bancrofti, and other nematodes, showing good therapeutic effects on this disease. It is administered once every 2 weeks, for 3 to 5 consecutive times. Adverse reactions are mild, with a few patients experiencing dizziness, abdominal pain, reduced appetite, and fatigue. Not suitable for infants, young children, and pregnant women. 
For ocular gnathostomiasis, surgical removal of Gnathostoma spinigerum larvae is the main treatment, as medication can worsen the condition and even lead to blindness. However, since gnathostomiasis patients often have Gnathostoma spinigerum larvae in other tissues as well, a course of medication is still recommended after the surgical removal of ocular larvae."
"Facial muscle spasms, pharyngeal spasms, unusual and disordered behavior, irritability, myoclonus, involuntary movements, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, lack of concentration, restlessness, compulsive behaviors, childhood tic disorder, nose-picking",Tourette Syndrome,"What are the treatment options for Tourette Syndrome? Generally, patients with mild symptoms may not require treatment. For those diagnosed, early pharmacotherapy is advised. The principles of treatment include: starting with a low dose and gradually increasing the dosage to minimize side effects, especially important when using neuroleptic drugs or clonidine. The treatment should have a definite course, an appropriate dose, and medications should not be switched too early. If only partial symptom improvement is observed with a single drug, or if Tourette Syndrome presents with complex accompanying symptoms, combination therapy may be considered. However, multiple drugs are not the best approach and should be approached with caution. As for maintenance therapy, since pharmacotherapy is symptomatic, a certain period of maintenance treatment should be carried out. The duration of maintenance therapy depends on the specific situation of each patient, requiring 6-12 months for milder patients, and 1-2 years or longer for severe patients. The maintenance dose generally ranges between 1/2 to 2/3 of the therapeutic dose. 
  1. Pharmacotherapy: 
  (1) Haloperidol: A selective central dopamine receptor blocker. Haloperidol has been widely used for Tourette Syndrome since its efficacy was reported by Seignot in 1961, with a success rate of 60%-90%, mainly effective for motor and vocal tics, enabling many patients to return to normal. However, its effect on other accompanying symptoms of Tourette Syndrome is not significant. Start with oral haloperidol 0.25-0.5mg, 2-3 times/day, or 0.5mg/day at bedtime, gradually increasing the dose usually every 3-5 days, effective doses often reach 5-30mg/day, generally 2-10mg/day for adults. The usual pediatric dose is 1.5-14mg/day [0.25-0.5mg/(kg·day)], adults up to 16mg/day [0.5mg/(kg·day)], which can be taken once or in divided doses. After symptom control, the dose should be gradually reduced to a daily maintenance dose of less than 10mg. 
  About half of the patients cannot tolerate its side effects, such as moodiness, drowsiness, extrapyramidal symptoms, cognitive dullness affecting learning, cardiac conduction block, etc., bradykinesia, and inability to sit still are the main adverse reactions of haloperidol treatment. Benzhexol is used concurrently to reduce extrapyramidal reactions. Some patients may experience oculogyric crises, i.e., rigid upward gaze, during the initial or dose-increasing period, which can be relieved by intramuscular administration of Scopolamine Hydrobromide. The minimum effective concentration of haloperidol is 2.0ng/ml, and blood drug levels above 6.0ng/ml may cause adverse reactions. 
  (2) Pimozide (Orap): Its efficacy is similar to that of haloperidol, but it does not have a sedative effect and is more acceptable to patients. Now widely used as a second-line drug. The action time of the drug is long, with a single oral administration time of 24 hours, so it can be taken once a day. The starting dose is 0.5-1mg/day, preferably taken in the morning; thereafter, the dose can be increased by a small amount each week until tic symptoms are controlled. The general pediatric dose is 2-6mg/day, the maximum dose 0.2mg/(kg·day), adults 4-12mg/day, maintenance dose 3-6mg. Pimozide causes cardiac conduction block more commonly than haloperidol, such as T wave inversion, the appearance of U waves, prolonged Q-T interval, bradycardia, etc. Therefore, an electrocardiogram should be performed before and every 1-2 months during treatment, and the drug should be discontinued if T wave inversion, the appearance of U waves, etc. occur; if the Q-T interval prolongation is not significant, the drug can continue to be used but no further increase in dose. Long-term use can cause anxiety. 
  (3) Tetrabenazine (Xenazine): Its efficacy is not as good as haloperidol, but its side effects are mild. It can be used for patients who do not tolerate haloperidol. Studies by Eggers et al. have shown that tetrabenazine has a definite therapeutic effect on Tourette Syndrome. The starting dose is 50-100mg/day, taken in 2-3 divided doses, then gradually increasing the dose according to the condition, the common dose is 200-300mg/day, children generally do not exceed 600mg/day. Most cases show efficacy 1-2 weeks after starting the medication. Adverse reactions include drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, and large doses can cause nausea and vomiting. 
  (4) Sulpitil: This drug also has a good effect in controlling tic symptoms. The antitic dose is 200-400mg/day. The main adverse reactions include drowsiness, depression, anxiety, mild tremors, and decreased libido. 
  (5) Pergolide: There have been reports of cases unresponsive to haloperidol and pimozide (Orap) treatment that achieved therapeutic effects with pergolide, and its adverse reactions, especially drowsiness, are lighter than other drugs (Shapim et al., 1983). 
  (6) Clonidine: An α2-adrenergic receptor blocker, its pharmacological action in treating Tourette Syndrome is thought to be the inhibition of norepinephrine release in the locus coeruleus, thus reducing tic symptoms. Clonidine is a safe and effective anti-tic drug, with an efficacy rate of 22%-70%, and takes 3 weeks or longer to become effective. Additionally, it is the first choice for treatment of accompanying attention deficit and hyperactivity. 
  Clonidine is available in tablet and skin patch forms. The starting oral dose is 0.025-0.075mg/day, taken in 2-3 divided doses, slowly increasing the dose, generally not exceeding a total daily amount of 0.5mg, or calculated based on 3μg(kg·day). For some children who are unwilling to take medication, patches can be used, with each patch containing 2mg to be attached behind both ears, 0.5-1 patch each time, replaced weekly. Adverse reactions of clonidine include drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, irritability, increased heart rate, and blood pressure decrease. During treatment, blood pressure and pulse should be monitored, and regular electrocardiograms are advisable. If adverse reactions occur, adjust the dose and slow down the rate of dose increase. Do not abruptly stop the medication during treatment, otherwise acute withdrawal reactions may occur. 
  (7) Clomipramine: This drug can increase brain 5-HT levels and is effective for obsessive-compulsive symptoms accompanying Tourette Syndrome, children 3mg/kg/day, adults starting dose 25mg/day, then slowly increasing the dose according to the condition, the maximum dose for adults is 250mg/day. Adverse reactions include dry mouth, sedation, tremors, constipation, urinary retention, and sexual dysfunction. 
  (8) Fluoxetine: A new generation antidepressant, starting dose is 20mg/day, then gradually increased to 60-80mg/day. Children are more sensitive to the activating effects of the drug, with a starting dose of 10-20mg every other day. Compared with clomipramine (clomipramine), the adverse reactions of fluoxetine are lighter and fewer. Fluoxetine can cause indigestion, nausea, rash, or exhibit mild mania-like manifestations. Studies have shown that children taking small doses of fluoxetine are very safe. 
  (9) Olanzapine: A atypical antipsychotic with a variety of receptor activities, including DA-2, 5-HT2A, and 2C antagonistic actions. Studies by Budman et al. have shown that this drug can significantly reduce tic symptoms, but it is ineffective for accompanying symptoms. The final dose is 2.5mg/day, average 10.9mg/day. Common adverse reactions include drowsiness, weight gain, increased appetite, dry mouth, transient asymptomatic hypoglycemia, etc. The authors believe that olanzapine can be used as a routine antipsychotic for treating motor tics and Tourette Syndrome. 
  (10) Drugs controlling attention deficit and hyperactivity: Clonidine is the first choice, as reported by Cohen (1992), clonidine has a good effect on Tourette Syndrome with accompanying attention deficit and hyperactivity. 
  (11) Inosine: Some believe that inosine treatment may be effective. Inosine is considered to be a purine metabolic intermediate that can rapidly enter the central nervous system through the blood-brain barrier and has sedative, anticonvulsant effects, and can increase dopamine release, thus it cannot be ruled out that inosine acts at the dopaminergic nerve terminal in a similar way to the dopamine receptor antagonist action of haloperidol. Domestic reports by Zhao Chunyu et al. showed that the combined treatment of inosine and haloperidol had a better effect, and could reduce the dosage of haloperidol, reducing adverse reactions. 
  Regarding combination, it is usually applied in the following situations: one is when the symptoms cannot be controlled by haloperidol alone or adverse reactions are too great to continue treatment; the other is when motor and vocal symptoms still exist after using clonidine. Haloperidol and clonidine are commonly used together, with the advantage that both are very low doses, which can achieve satisfactory results with fewer adverse reactions. Tetrabenazine can also be combined with haloperidol. 
  2. Psychotherapy: The negative impact of the disease on personality is very common, thus patients are highly affected psychologically, and some still cannot adapt to society even after tic control. Therefore, it is important to emphasize symptomatic treatment while paying attention to mental psychological treatment. 
  (1) Supportive psychotherapy: The purpose of psychotherapy for Tourette Syndrome patients is not to directly eliminate tic symptoms, but mainly to support and help patients eliminate psychological distress, reduce anxiety and depression, and adapt to the real environment. In addition to pharmacotherapy, the patient's learning and living environment should be taken into consideration, environmental stress resolved in a timely manner, and psychological therapy and education provided. 
  (2) Behavioral therapy usually includes the following methods: 
  ①Negative practice: Based on the theory that repeated movements can cause cumulative inhibition. Patients are asked to consciously repeat a certain tic movement for a designated time (15-30min), as time progresses, patients gradually feel tired, tic frequency decreases, symptoms alleviate. 
  ②Self-monitoring: Encourages patients to reduce or control tics through self-monitoring. Patients record their involuntary movements in detail every day during a designated period, such as the number of tics, frequency, and whether it is related to the environment, etc. Through a period of recording, patients' awareness of tics is enhanced, and they strive to overcome them. This method is suitable for adults or older children. 
  ③Relaxation training: Teaching patients to relax and regulate breathing, relaxing tense muscles, can reduce tic symptoms and also improve anxiety. 
  ④Behavioral reversal training: Behavioral reversal training uses a response opposite to or inconsistent with the tic as an antagonistic response to control the tic. An antagonistic response can be achieved by tensing the muscles corresponding to the tic to prevent motor tics from occurring. Using slow paced deep breathing through the nose while keeping the mouth closed can suppress vocal tics. Using slow paced deep breathing through the mouth can suppress nasal vocal tics. 
  3. Surgical treatment: For refractory Tourette Syndrome, surgical treatment can be used, often employing stereotactic surgery for lesioning procedures in the limbic leucotomy, ventrolateral thalamus, or thalamic intralaminar nuclei, with significant long-term therapeutic effects in reducing the severity of refractory Tourette Syndrome tics."
"Firm intradermal or subcutaneous nodules, osseous lesions",Syringoma,"The treatment options for Syringoma, particularly when there is no tendency for progression, typically do not require medical intervention. Nonetheless, electrolysis or CO2 laser therapy can be attempted. Topical applications of bleaching agents or 20% urea cream may facilitate epidermal exfoliation, alleviating the symptoms. While laser and cryotherapy are available options, they may result in scarring and have a high rate of recurrence. Repeated use of destructive treatments is highly likely to result in scarring. Surgical excision should be considered when necessary."
"The most common symptoms include dry cough, difficulty breathing after activity, weight loss, fatigue, fever, night sweats, and loss of appetite.",Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH),"The treatment strategies for Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) vary based on patient risk groups and organ involvement. In low-risk patients over the age of 2, without hematopoietic, liver, lung, or spleen involvement, minimal systemic treatment is often required, presenting little to no disability or mortality. However, high-risk patients under the age of 2, or those with the aforementioned organ involvements, may exhibit multiple organ symptoms due to persistent disease, thereby necessitating systemic treatments, which are generally effective. Patients with multisystem involvement, particularly those in young age groups, face a higher risk of disability and mortality rates up to 20%, despite common relapses, nearly all responsive patients may eventually cease treatment. Adult patients may experience a chronic, fluctuating disease course.

Severe cases require hospitalization with maximal-dose antibiotics, airway maintenance, nutritional support (including high-energy nutrition), blood products, skin care, physiotherapy, and essential medical care. Strict hygiene measures can significantly reduce auditory, skin, and gingival damage. Debridement, even with the excision of severely damaged gingival tissues, may be necessary to limit oral lesions. Seborrheic dermatitis in the scalp can be managed with selenium-containing shampoos (twice weekly); if ineffective, localized use of corticosteroid agents may control minor lesions in the short term. Patients with diabetes insipidus or other pituitary insufficiency symptoms often require hormone replacement therapy.

Local treatments (surgery and radiotherapy) are utilized after a thorough assessment for patients with single bone lesions or, in some cases, multiple affected sites. Surgical curettage is performed on superficial lesions located in accessible, non-dangerous areas, with caution to avoid extensive orthopedic and plastic surgeries that could impair function. Local radiotherapy (using high-voltage devices) is often applied for skeletal deformities, vision loss due to exophthalmos, pathological fractures, spinal compression, spinal cord injury, severe pain, or generalized lymph node enlargement.

Chemotherapy is administered to low-risk children over 2 years with single-system disease, or bone lesions at a single or multiple sites, typically receiving local treatment without the need for systemic therapy. However, ineffective treatment or persistent elevation of ESR may indicate severe systemic disease. Low-risk patients over 2 years with multisystem disease but without blood system, liver, lung, or spleen involvement may receive chemotherapy with lasting effectiveness. However, most patients under 2 years with the aforementioned organ system involvement, especially those with functional disorders, may still succumb despite chemotherapy.

Patients with very poor prognosis at diagnosis should undergo HLA typing, considering bone marrow transplantation, cyclosporine, experimental immunosuppressive, or other immunomodulatory treatments.

For patients with systemic LCH, chronic disabilities from the disease and treatment, such as cosmetic or functional orthopedic, skin lesions, neurotoxicity, and emotional fluctuations should be monitored."
"Chills and fever, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, petechiae, ecchymoses, scarlatiniform rash, joint swelling and pain, impaired mobility",Sepsis,"What are the treatment methods for sepsis? Western medicine treatment includes enlargement of the liver and spleen, rashes, increased respiratory and heart rates, and in severe cases, change in consciousness, septic shock, toxic hepatitis, myocarditis. A minority of cases may complicate with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and multiple organ failure syndrome (MOFS). Migratory lesions vary with the pathogen, commonly seen in pyogenic coccal and anaerobic bacterial sepsis, with common occurrences such as subcutaneous and deep muscle abscesses, pneumonia, exudative pleuritis, lung abscess, empyema, infective endocarditis, purulent pericarditis, brain abscess, osteomyelitis, etc. Common types of sepsis include: 1. Gram-positive cocci sepsis and Gram-negative bacilli sepsis, which account for over 70% of all sepsis cases, and use different antibiotics, thereby making preliminary diagnosis based on clinical manifestations extremely important. 2. Anaerobic bacterial sepsis, primarily caused by Bacteroides fragilis (accounting for 80% to 90%), other anaerobes include anaerobic streptococci and gas-forming capsulated bacilli. Clinical features include a jaundice occurrence rate of 10% to 40%, possibly related to the endotoxins of Bacteroides fragilis directly acting on the liver or the hemolytic effect of alpha toxin from gas-forming capsulated bacilli. Migratory lesions with gas formation, notably in bacteremia caused by gas-forming capsulated bacilli; secretion with a specific foul odor in local lesions; prone to septic thrombophlebitis with migratory damages and abscesses in thoracoabdominal, cardiac, cerebral, pulmonary, osseous, and articular areas, mostly seen in Bacteroides fragilis and anaerobic streptococcal sepsis; severe hemolytic anemia is mainly observed in sepsis caused by gas-forming capsulated bacilli, possibly accompanied by renal failure. 3. Fungal sepsis, with an increasing incidence in recent years, mostly caused by Candida albicans. Clinical manifestations are generally milder than bacterial sepsis, with some cases presenting no fever or low fever, no obvious symptoms or symptoms masked by the primary disease, a considerable number of cases diagnosed postmortem. Fungal sepsis generally occurs in the late stage of serious underlying diseases, progresses slowly, and apart from blood culture detection of pathogenic fungi, oral, sputum, stool, urine, and other cultures can obtain the same fungi. All tissues and organs in the body can be involved, presenting multiple small abscesses, and can lead to life-threatening complications such as endocarditis and meningitis. Special types of sepsis: 1. Polymicrobial sepsis, defined as the isolation of two or more bacteria or other microorganisms from the blood or bone marrow samples of the same patient. The incidence rate is 14% to 17%, often occurring on the basis of other chronic diseases or other causes that significantly weaken the patient's resistance. The types of pathogens are numerous, mainly including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus, and some fungi. Clinical manifestations are similar to those of monomicrobial sepsis but more severe, such as the occurrence of chills, high fever or temperature not rising, deterioration into a worsening condition, more obvious signs than originally, and changes in blood examination, then the possibility of this disease should be considered, and timely blood culture should be performed, ideally simultaneously drawing venous blood for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and fungal cultures. 2. Neonatal sepsis: Neonatal sepsis differs from adult sepsis due to anatomical, physiological, immune characteristics, and even within the neonatal period, differences exist due to age. The incidence rate is highest in newborns, about 1% to 5%; common pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella species, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Group B beta-hemolytic streptococci etc. Clinical manifestations include a sudden onset, rapid changes, and can rapidly develop into failure and shock within hours. For older children, besides chills, high fever, delirium, cyanotic facial expression, poor circulation, early and severe symptoms of the nervous and respiratory systems appear, and digestive system symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea (prominent liver and spleen enlargement) are observed. Once respiratory failure occurs, circulatory failure follows. Newborn sepsis has no distinctive features, such as refusal to feed, poor response, weak crying, no weight gain, deepening jaundice, fever or temperature not rising suggests the disease; if cyanotic facial expression, cold limbs, or sudden overall failure indicates shock. Since the blood-brain barrier function in newborns is not yet sound, 25% to 30% of the children can spread to the central nervous system. A positive blood culture plus one of the following can confirm the diagnosis, one meaning infections in more than two organs; or systemic infection symptoms (such as high fever or temperature not rising, jaundice, bleeding, abdominal distension, poor peripheral circulation, frequent respiratory pauses, acidosis, etc.) two or more plus an organ infection. If the blood culture is negative, in addition to the above, short-term antibiotic treatment ineffective should also consider sepsis. 3. Sepsis in the elderly: Often occurs on the basis of chronic diseases such as cardiopulmonary disease, cholelithiasis, prostatic hypertrophy, diabetes, hematologic disorders, tumors, and chronic heart, liver, and renal diseases. With a sudden onset and rapid progression, typical symptoms are often lacking, shock and MOFS can occur, with a poor prognosis and high mortality rate. Pathogens mainly include Gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus, often secondary to lung and pressure sore infections. 4. Nosocomial sepsis: Drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are stubborn pathogens, often leading to polymicrobial infections. Clinical symptoms are more severe than general sepsis, presenting high fever, shock. Toxic myocarditis, toxic hepatitis manifestations, with an extremely high mortality rate. 5. Burn sepsis: Commonly occurs after 36 hours of burn injury when tissue fluid begins reabsorption, bacteria along enter the bloodstream. Drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are stubborn pathogens, often leading to polymicrobial infections. Clinical symptoms are more severe than general sepsis, presenting high fever, shock. Toxic myocarditis, toxic hepatitis manifestations, with an extremely high mortality rate. 6. Bacterial L-form sepsis: Bacterial L-form refers to Gram-positive and negative bacteria lacking a cell wall, difficult to grow but can grow in culture media supplemented with serum and maintained at high osmotic pressure. Bacterial L-forms are widely distributed in nature and can also be isolated from almost all types of clinical specimens. Previously considered nonpathogenic, but recent clinical isolates of L-forms have mostly been pathogenic, causing subacute endocarditis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, cholecystitis, pyelonephritis, sepsis, and arthritis. Clinical characteristics include chronic, recurrent episodes of irregular fever, temperature can reach 38 to 40°C, accompanied by chills, night sweats, malaise, and weight loss. Disturbances in consciousness and somnolence are common, toxic symptoms are pronounced, white blood cell count is elevated. If untreated properly, the mortality rate can reach 50%. Traditional Chinese medicine treatment: 1. General treatment should mainly clear heat and detoxify for excess syndromes, and support the righteous and expel evil for deficiency syndromes. (1) Exuberant heat toxin: Treatment should clear heat and detoxify, clear the nutrient level and cool blood. Commonly used Qingwen Baidu Drink with modifications.

Combined traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatment: Sepsis has a sudden onset, a serious condition, multifaceted symptoms, and rapid changes, requiring close observation and a comprehensive treatment approach combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Early venous administration of combined, adequate, and long-course antimicrobial therapy as the main comprehensive treatment, the vast majority can be cured. If the treatment effect is unsatisfactory, according to the diseased location and the differentiation of deficiency and excess, treatment of clearing heat and detoxifying, cooling blood and discharging the nutrient level with decoction therapy can be applied to accelerate disease recovery. If persistent high fever, uncontrollable convulsions, poor drug efficacy, non-pharmacological treatments can be considered."
"Skin itching, greasy scales, hair loss",Seborrheic Dermatitis,"What are the treatment methods for Seborrheic Dermatitis?

"Fever, anemia, joint pain, loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, cachexia, difficulty in swallowing, hemoptysis",Cardiac Myxoma,"What are the treatment methods for cardiac myxoma?
    Once cardiac myxoma is diagnosed, general symptomatic treatment, anti-arrhythmic, and heart failure medications often have limited efficacy.
    Surgical Treatment: Cardiac myxomas are located in the heart chamber and can cause mechanical obstruction of blood flow, affecting the function of the atrioventricular valves. Patients often experience rapid changes in their condition, leading to quick heart failure progression. Medication treatment is insufficient, and there is always a risk of fragment embolism or tumor blockage of the atrioventricular valve orifice, causing sudden death or arterial embolism. Therefore, prompt surgical treatment should be sought after diagnosis. If infections or heart failure that temporarily precludes surgery are present, aggressive treatment should be initiated to prepare for surgery.
        (1) Surgical Approach: The excision of intra-cardiac myxomas is ideally performed under cardiopulmonary bypass with hypothermia and cardiac arrest. Currently, all cardiac myxomas are removed under direct vision after arresting the heart, which has shown satisfactory results. The main surgical concern involves the potential embolism from tumor fragmentation. Therefore, before blocking circulation, do not manipulate or compress the heart, and avoid intracardiac exploration. When establishing cardiopulmonary bypass, handle the procedure delicately. The tumor should be completely removed; if broken, thoroughly wash the cardiac chambers and remove all residual fragments. To prevent recurrence, it is necessary to excise the attachment point of the tumor pedicle (usually located in the area of the fossa ovalis or atrial wall), then reconstruct it with a patch.
        (2) Surgical Path: The choice of cardiac incision is critical for exposing the tumor, identifying the pedicle, and removing the tumor completely along with a part of the cardiac wall or septum tissue attached to the pedicle. With advances in cardiovascular treatments, the approach for cardiac myxoma surgeries has become relatively uniform: entering via a median sternotomy, with the approach of opening the right atrium to enter the left atrium through the interatrial septum being superior to entering directly through the atrial grove. The reason being that opening the interatrial septum usually places the tumor within sight, making it easier to locate the pedicle for complete and thorough excision.
        (3) Surgical Steps:
            i. Incision and Exploration: A median sternotomy is used, and the pericardium is longitudinally opened to observe cardiac pulsation and the extent of left atrial enlargement.
            ii. Establishing Cardiopulmonary Bypass: Standard practice involves cannulation in the ascending aorta and both vena cavae.
            iii. Atrial Incision: In the past, left atrial incisions were commonly used. Recently, dual atrial or atrium and interatrial septum incisions are advocated.
            iv. Tumor Excision: The tumor and its pedicle are fully excised.
            v. Repairing Septal Defects and Suturing Incisions: The left atrial myxoma necessitates removal of the atrial septum around the tumor pedicle.
        (4) Treatment Outcomes: With the application of new diagnostic techniques, most cases can have a confirmed diagnosis preoperatively, hence a high surgical safety, removal rate, and cure rate. However, postoperative complications are often the cause of death. According to reports from Fuwai Hospital, among 148 cases, there were 10 deaths, with 4 due to low cardiac output and 2 to arrhythmias. According to international literature, most patients with left and right atrial myxomas have good long-term outcomes following surgery, with a 10-15 year follow-up showing a recurrence rate of about 1% to 5%. There are also isolated recurrence case reports in China, accounting for approximately 2%."
"Cerebral cell dehydration, nausea and vomiting, oliguria, hypernatremia, dehydration, somnolence, convulsions, seizures and epileptic seizures, coma, hypertension, hypokalemia",Hypernatremia,"The treatment for hypernatremia includes addressing and removing the underlying cause whenever possible. For instance, immediate water intake can correct hypernatremia caused by dehydration. Different approaches are employed for hypernatremia due to excessive dehydration or sodium excretion disorders.
1. For hypernatremia due to excessive dehydration, besides addressing the underlying cause, the main focus is on correcting dehydration. The dehydration volume can be calculated as follows: For males, water deficit = 0.6 × Body Weight × [1 - (Normal serum sodium concentration)/(Patient’s serum sodium concentration)]. For females, water deficit = 0.5 × Body Weight × [1 - (Normal serum sodium concentration)/(Patient’s serum sodium concentration)]. The body weight here refers to the patient's weight before the onset of the disease. The calculated water deficit is an approximation and does not include the deficit of isotonic fluids, physiological daily fluids (around 1500ml per day), and continuing losses. If the original body weight is unknown, the required water replacement volume can be calculated as follows: For males, required water volume = 4 × Current Body Weight × Desired decrease in sodium concentration (mmol/L). For females, required water volume = 3 × Current Body Weight × Desired decrease in sodium concentration (mmol/L).
2. For fluid replacement, the preferred solution is isotonic saline mixed with 5% dextrose, in either a 1/4:3/4 or 1:1 ratio. The dextrose is rapidly metabolized once inside the body, making the mixed solution hypotonic. Alternatively, 0.45% saline or 5% dextrose solution may be used.
3. For the route of fluid administration, oral intake is preferred. If the patient cannot drink by themselves, administration via a nasogastric tube is safe and reliable, typically for mild cases. For severe symptoms, especially those with central nervous system manifestations, intravenous administration is necessary. Care must be taken not to replenish fluids too quickly during intravenous fluid replacement, and closely monitor serum sodium concentration, aiming for a decrease no greater than 0.5mmol/L per hour, to avoid osmotic imbalance in cerebral cells leading to cerebral edema.
4. Treatment of hypernatremia due to sodium excretion disorders mainly involves eliminating excess sodium from the body. Administer 5% dextrose solution along with sodium-excreting diuretics such as furosemide or ethacrynic acid to increase sodium excretion. Since these diuretics have a stronger effect on water than on sodium, fluid replacement must also be ensured. If the patient has renal failure, blood or peritoneal dialysis may be considered. The dialysate should preferably contain hypertonic glucose. Similarly, the rate of sodium decrease should be monitored to prevent too rapid a reduction, which could lead to cerebral edema."
"Mass, Tenderness",Inguinal Hernia,"What are the treatment options for inguinal hernia?

    Treatment for inguinal hernia includes conservative and surgical approaches. An irreducible hernia leading to incarceration can cause intestinal obstruction, or even intestinal necrosis, perforation, and potentially fatal outcomes.

    1. Non-surgical Treatment

    Conservative treatment encompasses the use of hernia belts, trusses, and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). These methods can alleviate symptoms or delay the progression of the disease but are not curative. Some inappropriate conservative treatments may even exacerbate the condition. This approach is only suitable for infants under one year, elderly individuals, or patients with severe co-morbidities who cannot withstand surgery.

    2. Surgical Treatment

    The most effective treatment for inguinal hernia is surgical repair. Reducible hernias can be treated with elective surgery, whereas non-reducible hernias should be operated on within a short time frame. Incarcerated and strangulated hernias require emergency surgery to avoid severe consequences. Surgical methods can be summarized into the following three types:

    (1) Traditional hernia repair: The fundamental principle involves high ligation of the hernia sac and reinforcement or repair of the inguinal canal wall. In infants and young children, the abdominal muscles gradually strengthen, making the abdominal wall more robust. High ligation of the hernia sac alone often results in satisfactory outcomes and obviates the need for hernioplasty. Strangulated hernia with intestinal necrosis and severe local infection is usually managed with high ligation of the hernia sac alone.

    Methods to reinforce or repair the inguinal canal wall primarily include the Ferguson technique for anterior inguinal canal wall repair and the Bassini, Halsted, McVay, and Shouldice techniques for posterior inguinal canal wall repair.

    (2) Tension-free hernioplasty: Traditional hernia repair has drawbacks such as high suture tension, postoperative discomfort, and pain at the surgical site. Tension-free hernioplasty features postoperative pain reduction, faster recovery, and lower recurrence rates. Popular techniques include the Lichtenstein procedure, Rutkow technique, and Stoppa operation.

    (3) Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair: Significant progress has been made in laparoscopic surgery in recent years. The main methods include the Transabdominal Preperitoneal (TAP), Totally Extraperitoneal Approach (TEA), Intraperitoneal Onlay Mesh (IPOM), and simple herniorrhaphy."
"Menstrual delay, amenorrhea, nipple discharge, infertility",Galactorrhea-Amenorrhea Syndrome,"The treatment methods for Galactorrhea-Amenorrhea Syndrome typically focus on addressing the specific causative factors that lead to elevated prolactin levels, hence causing the syndrome. 
1. In cases caused by pituitary tumors such as pituitary microadenomas or other tumors related to prolactin secretion, surgery is recommended if conditions permit; if surgery is not feasible, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatments can be alternatives. 
2. For elevated prolactin levels induced by various medications, it is crucial to discontinue the implicated drugs immediately upon diagnosis. Symptoms generally resolve after stopping the medication. 
3. If the condition is due to dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis leading to elevated prolactin levels, appropriate medicinal treatments should be administered to regulate this system, thereby reducing prolactin levels and restoring normal ovulation and menstruation. Bromocriptine mainly acts on the pituitary cells that secrete prolactin, reducing prolactin secretion; Levodopa primarily affects the hypothalamus, enhancing the action of prolactin-inhibiting factors, thus reducing prolactin levels. The dosage and administration of these medications should strictly follow medical advice. Menstruation can be restored within 1 to several months of medication, though side effects like nausea, vomiting, and dizziness might occur. 
4. In cases caused by hypothyroidism, oral thyroxine treatment is advisable, with dosage and administration following medical advice. 
5. TCM treatment can effectively regulate the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, reduce prolactin secretion levels, improve symptoms, and adjust the internal environment of the body, avoiding the side effects of Western medication. For Qi and blood deficiency, Qi-nourishing and blood-enriching treatments are recommended, adjusting the medicine based on Ginseng Yang Rong Soup; for liver Qi stagnation, treatments should focus on soothing the liver, regulating Qi, and promoting blood circulation, adjusting the medicine based on Xiaoyao San combined with Tao Hong Si Wu Soup. TCM treatment requires a clear diagnosis as its prerequisite. In the presence of organic lesions such as pituitary tumors, surgical treatment should be promptly sought without delay."
"Skin pigmentation, café-au-lait spots, skin or subcutaneous nodules",Neurofibromatosis,"The treatment strategies for neurofibromatosis are determined based on typical clinical manifestations, and imaging findings from CT scans and MRIs. 
1. NFIX linear radiography may reveal multiple subcutaneous nodular shadows, which tend to be soft and have low density. 
2. Due to the superior spatial resolution of X-rays and the high-density resolution of CT scans, these imaging techniques are indispensable for identifying bone lesions associated with NFI, such as scoliosis, cranial suture defects, and hypoplasia of the wings of the sphenoid bone. For NFII, significant findings include an enlarged internal acoustic meatus or bone destruction, and bone changes or enlargement of the spinal nerve foramina secondary to intramedullary or nerve root tumors. 
3. MRI is highly sensitive and capable of multiplanar imaging without radiation exposure, making it non-invasive. It can detect more intracranial lesions than CT scans, including minor lesions. The detection and measurement of lesion sizes rely on MRI and enhanced MRI examinations. Neurofibromatosis can lead to multiple lesions in the central nervous system. On MRI, bilateral vestibular schwannomas are often seen, usually more prominent on one side, along with neurofibromas affecting multiple cranial and peripheral nerves, and may also be associated with meningiomas or gliomas."
"Extreme emaciation, spinal protrusion, malnutrition",Rickets,The main approach to treating rickets focuses on the elimination of the condition. Treatment varies based on the diagnosis and may include medications such as Aloe Vera pills.
"Timidity, panic attacks, fear, persecutory delusion",Panic Disorder,"What are the treatment options for panic disorder? How should panic disorder be treated? 

Treatment aims to control panic attacks as soon as possible, prevent recurrence, and avoid the development of agoraphobia. 

1. Early treatment: In addressing the initial panic attack, it's crucial to explain to the patient that the somatic symptoms caused by anxiety, though seemingly frightening, are harmless. It's also essential to clarify cognitive distortions induced by anxiety, such as fears of losing self-control or dying, which can perpetuate the anxiety cycle. Patients should be informed about the significance of avoidance behavior, as avoiding places where panic disorder occurred can lead to agoraphobia.

2. Pharmacotherapy includes the following options:
(a) Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs): High doses of some antidepressants have anti-panic effects, thus often used as first-line treatments, frequently choosing clomipramine with a daily dose of 50-300mg. The dose starts from a small amount of 10mg or 25mg, gradually increasing, with most patients requiring at least 150mg per day for effectiveness. Clomipramine (25-200mg/day) can also be used. For those who cannot tolerate anticholinergic side effects, desipramine can be an alternative. For elderly patients prone to hypotension, nortriptyline is a choice. Amitriptyline, similar to benzodiazepines in reducing panic attacks and with a lesser likelihood of dependency and withdrawal reactions, acts slowly and possesses many adverse effects. Approximately two-thirds of patients who respond to benzodiazepines or amitriptyline relapse within six weeks after discontinuation, requiring further treatment.
(b) Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) can be used as first-line drugs, especially for those intolerant to TCAs' side effects; they are preferred for patients with concurrent OCD or social phobia. Commonly used SSRIs include paroxetine (20-60mg/day), fluoxetine (5-20mg/day), sertraline (50-150mg/day), and fluvoxamine (150mg/day). Newer antidepressants like SSRIs, SNRIs (venlafaxine and its extended-release formulations), and NaSSAs (mirtazapine) can also control panic attack symptoms, analogous to amitriptyline, sans its anticholinergic and cardiovascular adverse effects.
(c) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Suitable for patients intolerant to other antidepressants; preferred for those with atypical depression or social phobia. Common drugs include phenelzine (15-60-90mg/day) and tranylcypromine (10-80mg/day).
(d) High-potency benzodiazepines: Applicable for those intolerant to various antidepressants; first choice in cases requiring rapid effect. Common drugs include alprazolam and clonazepam, with the latter having a longer action duration and fewer withdrawal reactions. Benzodiazepines must be used in high doses for extended periods to control panic attacks but can lead to dependency and withdrawal reactions.
(e) Other drugs: Venlafaxine (50-75mg/day) and nefazodone (200-600mg/day) can be experimented with in patients who do not respond well to other medications.

Due to the high relapse rate of this disease, the treatment period should generally not be shorter than six months; some cases require 3-5 years of medication to achieve full remission.

3. Psychotherapy: After controlling panic attacks with medication, psychotherapy is often necessary to eliminate anticipatory anxiety and phobic avoidance.
(a) Supportive psychotherapy explains the nature of the disease to reduce the mental burden on patients, encourages adherence to the treatment plan, and promotes group therapy participation for mutual support.
(b) Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) offers effects comparable to pharmacotherapy in the short term and a lower relapse rate. However, this therapy requires specialists and is time-consuming, generally preceded by pharmacotherapy."
"Increased muscle tone, muscle atrophy in hands, hyperreflexia, difficulty swallowing, speech disorders, choking on water, sensory impairment",Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS),"What are the treatment options for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)? 
1. Oral administration of Vitamin E and B-complex vitamins. 
2. Coenzyme injections, cytidine diphosphate choline injections, etc., can be applied intermittently. 
3. For muscle spasms, medications such as Diazepam taken orally, and Baclofen are administered in divided doses. 
4. Some drugs that may be trialed for this condition include Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone, Interferons, Lecithin, Testosterone, Cysteine, immunosuppressants, as well as plasmapheresis, their efficacy, however, is difficult to assess. 
5. With the advancement of stem cell technology in recent years, stem cell therapy has become one of the treatment methods for this disease, which can alleviate and improve the condition.

7. For those with difficulty swallowing, nasogastric feeding is used to maintain intake of nutrients and fluids. 
8. For respiratory muscle paralysis, ventilatory support is provided with a respirator. 
9. Prevention and treatment of pulmonary infections."
"Pain, numbness in shoulder, arm, and hand, possible muscle atrophy and weakness, hand discoloration to a purplish hue, and diminished radial artery pulse",Thoracic Outlet Syndrome,"What are the treatment options for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome? 
Pre-treatment considerations for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome: 
Conservative treatment is similar to that for Anterior Scalene Syndrome. If conservative measures fail and symptoms are severe, surgical intervention is indicated. The surgical technique involves the transaxillary resection of the first rib: The patient is placed in a lateral decubitus position with the affected side up. An incision is made in the axilla along the skin crease, extending from the anterior margin of the pectoralis major and across the posterior margin of the axilla. The skin and subcutaneous tissue are incised to expose the first and second ribs and the anterior scalene muscle. Lifting the upper limb completely exposes the first rib, which is carefully separated, identifying various structures where the brachial plexus is posterior, the subclavian vein anterior, and the subclavian artery and anterior scalene muscle in between. The anterior and middle scalene muscles are then transected at their insertion points, as well as the origin of the subclavian muscle. Care should be taken not to damage the internal jugular vein when mobilizing the anterior scalene muscle. When performing subperiosteal resection of the first rib, care must be taken to avoid injuring the pleura. The first rib is transected near its cartilaginous junction, and an arthrotomy is performed at the transverse process posteriorly. In the event of pleural rupture, a small urethral catheter is inserted through the tear, securing the surrounding pleura around the catheter, which is then connected to a water seal bottle for closed drainage."
"Fatigue, weakness, neck pain, neck stiffness, cyanosis, hypersensitivity, shoulder pain, localized tenderness",Thoracic Outlet Syndrome,"The treatment options for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome primarily include conservative methods. For most cases, conservative treatment can alleviate pain, involving exercises to strengthen the shoulder muscles to elevate the shoulders and altering the patient’s work and sleep habits to prevent shoulder drooping. Massage therapy may also reduce symptoms. Surgical treatment involves a supraclavicular approach: a 6-8 cm transverse incision is made above the supraclavicular fossa, starting from the superolateral aspect of the sternoclavicular joint and extending upwards and backwards. Underneath the skin incision, the omohyoid muscle is transected, and the sternal end of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is identified and cut. The external jugular vein, suprascapular artery, and transverse cervical artery are identified anterior to the anterior scalene muscle and ligated. The scapulohyoideus muscle is transected, and the phrenic nerve is identified anterior to the anterior scalene muscle, freed, and retracted medially. The anterior scalene muscle is separated at its insertion point while avoiding damage to the subclavian vein located anterior and inferior to the muscle. The subclavian artery and brachial plexus are located posterior to the muscle. The effectiveness of relieving pressure on these structures by transecting the anterior scalene muscle is evaluated, carefully observing the neurovascular bundle inside the middle scalene muscle for any fibrous tendonous bands compressing these structures, abnormality of the scalene muscles, cervical ribs, or an enlarged C7 transverse process. The cervical rib passes between the anterior and middle scalene muscles, bending the lowest root of the brachial plexus and the subclavian artery over the rib, aiming to relieve compression on the nerves and vessels. The cervical rib is carefully freed and partially or completely resected. All fibrous bands are removed, and if the middle scalene muscle tightly encases the brachial plexus, sufficient muscle is removed to relieve the compression. Care is taken in some cases where part of the brachial plexus nerves might pierce the scalene muscles, as blind transection of these muscles may damage the plexus. After surgery, the incision is closed, a rubber drain is placed, removed after 24 hours, and stitches are removed in a week."
"Visual impairment, black shadows in front of the eyes, distorted vision, blurry vision",Retinitis Pigmentosa,"The treatment methods for Retinitis Pigmentosa include: 
1. Extensive use of antiviral drugs. 
2. Oral administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, Vitamin B complex, and Vitamin C. 
3. Extensive use of vasodilators and energy tonics. 
4. Traditional Chinese Medicine: Heat-clearing and detoxifying agents. 
For complex cases of retinal detachment, including refractive media opacification, complex giant retinal breaks with flipped valves, severe PVR (Proliferative VitreoRetinopathy) where scleral buckling surgery does not relieve vitreoretinal traction, and failed gas tamponade surgery for macular or posterior pole holes, vitrectomy combined with intravitreal silicone oil or gas tamponade is used. This approach has made it possible for many cases previously considered inoperable to achieve surgical success."
"Fever, rash, non-purulent cervical lymphadenopathy, conjunctival congestion",Kawasaki Disease,"Treatment options for Kawasaki Disease include: 
 
1. Enhanced care to prevent secondary infections and complications. 
 
2. Aspirin is the first choice of medication. 
 
3. Antibiotics may be used to prevent secondary infections. 
 
Western medicine treatment involves the use of Panshengding, inosine, and energy cocktails for 1-2 treatment courses, in combination with aspirin and corticosteroids. Penicillin or ampicillin may be used for secondary infections. 
 
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatments include: 
(a) Intravenous drip of 4ml Danshen injection (equivalent to 6g of Danshen) with 10% glucose solution, once daily for 10 days, completing two treatment cycles. 
(b) Bai Hu Tang modified according to symptoms: gypsum (30-50g), Anemarrhena asphodeloides (6-10g), Isatis root (15-30g), Glehnia root (20g), Ophiopogon japonicus (10g), Pueraria lobata (20g), Lophatherum gracile (6g), Artemisia annua (10g). The formula is decocted in water and taken once daily for 10-15 days, constituting one treatment course. 
(c) Topical medication: Apply watermelon frost to the affected areas of the mouth."
"Fever, tachycardia, rapid breathing",Sepsis,"What are the treatment methods for sepsis? Early Goal-Directed Therapy (EGDT) and bundle therapy are currently recommended to implement sepsis treatment guidelines more effectively and standardize the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock. These guidelines suggest combining significant measures to form a set of strategies, namely Early Goal-Directed Therapy and bundle therapy. Early Goal-Directed Therapy (EGDT) involves aggressive fluid resuscitation as soon as severe sepsis with inadequate tissue perfusion is clinically diagnosed. The goals to be achieved within the initial 6 hours of diagnosing hemodynamic instability include: Central Venous Pressure (CVP) 8-12 mmHg; Central Venous Oxygen Saturation (ScvO2) ≥70%; Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) ≥65 mmHg; Urine output >0.5 ml/kg/h. The sepsis bundle treatment includes early measurement of serum lactate levels; obtaining microbiological specimens before administering antibiotics; starting broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 3 hours in the emergency department and within 1 hour in the ICU; implementing EGDT and conducting hemodynamic monitoring with the placement of a central venous catheter to monitor CVP and ScvO2 within 1-2 hours; controlling hyperglycemia; applying low-dose corticosteroids; implementing mechanical ventilation with controlled plateau pressures."
"Fever, cough with sputum, fatigue, chest tightness and shortness of breath, difficulty breathing",Pneumocystis Pneumonia,"The treatment for Pneumocystis Pneumonia includes the following options: 
1. Potassium iodide is the first choice of medication for this condition. For adults, a 10% solution of potassium iodide is administered three times daily, or a saturated solution of potassium iodide starting with 10 drops three times a day. The dosage is then increased by 5 drops daily until reaching 40 drops per dose. After the lesion has resolved, continue taking the medication for one month to prevent recurrence. 
2. For patients allergic to iodide or when it is ineffective: 
    (a) Amphotericin B, though it has significant side effects such as fever, damage to liver, kidneys, hematopoietic system, hypokalemia, etc., and requires caution. 
    (b) Dihydroxystilbamidine is administered in a 5% glucose solution by intravenous drip, with 7 to 10 days constituting one treatment course, repeated until the lesion is fully absorbed. 
    (c) Ketoconazole and Fluconazole, taken once to twice daily; the latter can also be administered in a glucose solution via intravenous drip."
"Abdominal pain, granuloma",Gnathostomiasis,"The treatment for gnathostomiasis involves a multifaceted approach. For severe cases, corticosteroids, such as prednisone, can be administered initially to alleviate symptoms and reduce the eosinophil count. The dosage of prednisone recommended is 1-2mg/kg per day for a period of 3-5 days. After achieving temporary relief, efforts should be made to identify the underlying cause for targeted treatment. In cases where the gnathostomiasis affects the stomach or esophagus, the larva can be removed endoscopically. For ectopic lesions, albendazole can be administered orally at a dosage of 500mg three times a day for 3 days. Surgical intervention may be necessary if required."
"High fever with chills, headache, vomiting, maculopapular rash, joint pain, fever, rash, bacterial endocarditis",Actinomycosis,"The treatment for Actinomycosis involves bed rest during acute phases, providing easily digestible foods, and symptomatic treatment such as hydration when necessary. The most crucial step is the immediate administration of a sufficient dose of antimicrobial agents. Penicillin is the preferred choice, with erythromycin and clindamycin as alternatives for those allergic to penicillin. In cases of neonatal meningitis, high doses of penicillin or ampicillin have been found to be effective. Regardless of the chosen medication, the treatment duration should not be less than 10 days."
"Skin itching, severe itching, erythematous rash, headache, proteinuria, conjunctival congestion, fatigue, asthma, diarrhea, fever, herpes, papules",Demodicosis,"The treatment for demodicosis includes symptomatic treatment, such as the use of washes containing 1%–2% menthol or phenolated calamine, or 5% camphor alcohol. For widespread lesions or severe itching, topical corticosteroid creams can be used, alongside oral antihistamines. For secondary infections, topical antibiotic ointments should be applied."
"Severe itching, blisters",Caterpillar Dermatitis,"Treatment options for Caterpillar Dermatitis include several measures starting with precautions. Precautionary measures involve enhancing personal protection; when working in epidemic areas, wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers, tightly secure the cuffs and trouser legs, wear hats, neck scarfs, goggles, and masks. Avoid cooling off or drying clothes, bedding, and diapers under trees hosting caterpillars or in their downwind during summer. Close doors and windows facing the wind during strong winds to prevent toxic hairs from entering. 
For Chinese medicine treatments of Caterpillar Dermatitis, local treatment principles focus on removing toxic hairs, alleviating pain, reducing inflammation, and preventing scratching. Treatments may include applying Chinese herbal plasters or adhesive tapes, using transparent adhesive tape to stick more on the affected area to remove toxic hairs. Then, various external anti-inflammatory and antipruritic agents are used, such as camphor, coal tar solution, freshly pounded Portulaca oleracea, or fresh Aloe vera mixed with realgar powder for external application. For cases with severe itching, antihistamines may be administered. Additionally, internal administration of Chinese medicine decoctions that clear heat and dampness can be adjusted and administered."
"Symptoms depend on the level of spinal lesion and may include shoulder and upper limb pain, intercostal neuralgia, bilateral lower limb radiating pain, muscle atrophy in hands, paralysis of limbs, sensory loss, skin trophic disturbances, and urinary incontinence.",Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome,"The treatment approaches for Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome includes: 
1. Proper immobilization to prevent further spinal cord injury due to displacement of the injured site. Initially, jaw-traction bands or continuous cranial traction is generally applied. 
2. Reducing spinal edema and secondary damage through: (a) Dexamethasone, 10-20 mg intravenous infusion, continued for 5-7 days followed by oral administration, three times daily, each dose being 0.75 mg for about 2 weeks. (b) Mannitol, 20% solution 250 ml intravenous drip twice daily for 5-7 sessions. (c) Methylprednisolone pulse therapy, a 30 mg/kg dose administered at once, followed by an intravenous injection over 15 minutes, resting for 45 minutes, then a continuous intravenous drip of 5.4 mg/kg for the next 23 hours, only for patients within 8 hours post-injury. (d) Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) for one month, optimally starting within 2 hours post-injury for best effects; however, good results can generally be achieved when applied within 4-6 hours post-injury according to experimental and clinical experiences. 
3. Surgical intervention primarily aims at relieving spinal compression and restoring spinal stability; however, it cannot reverse damage or restore function to the injured spinal cord. The surgical approach and method depend on the fracture type and the location of compression. 
Differentiation between intermittent claudication of spinal origin and vascular intermittent claudication is essential, where the latter presents with reduced skin temperature, diminished or absent dorsalis pedis artery pulses, and ultrasonography Doppler examination can aid in differentiation."
"Chills, high fever, dry mouth, bitter taste, abscess, breast lump, headache, chest tightness",Mastitis,"What are the treatment methods for mastitis?
Prevention: The primary causes of acute mastitis are the obstruction of milk flow, leading to stasis, and reduced local breast tissue vitality, creating conditions favorable for bacterial proliferation. Therefore, fundamentally, milk stasis and bacterial infection are the two main causes of this disease. The primary preventive measures for mastitis are to prevent milk stasis and bacterial infection.
1. Prevent nipple cracks. Nipple cracks not only easily lead to milk stasis but may also cause bacterial infection due to the wound.
(a) From the sixth month of pregnancy, wash the nipples daily with a towel dipped in warm water to prevent biting through.
(b) Do not allow the infant to develop the habit of sleeping while suckling.
(c) After breastfeeding, wash the nipples clean and use a soft cloth as a barrier between the nipple and clothing to avoid abrasions.
2. Actively treat nipple cracks to prevent complications.
(a) For mild nipple cracks, continue breastfeeding and apply a 10% compound benzoin tincture or 10% bismuth subgallate in cod liver oil after each feed. Cleanse before the next breastfeeding session.
(b) For severe nipple cracks with intense pain during breastfeeding, use a nipple shield for indirect breastfeeding; or express milk with a breast pump and feed the infant with a bottle.
(c) For crusts on the nipple, do not forcibly remove. Apply vegetable oil until it softens gradually for removal.
3. Prevent milk stasis.
(a) Initiate breastfeeding as soon as possible after childbirth.
(b) Apply warm compresses to the breasts before breastfeeding to promote milk flow. If experiencing breast swelling and pain, apply warm compresses timely and massage the breast, pulling the nipple.
(c) If the infant's sucking strength is insufficient or the infant's intake is small compared to milk secretion, use a breast pump to express milk thoroughly.
(d) Pay attention to cleaning the nipples, removing any buildup at the milk duct openings.
4. Keep the breasts clean to prevent bacterial infection. Clean the breasts before childbirth to remove any sticky dirt on the nipples; wash the nipples before breastfeeding, especially if there are cracks; avoid compressing the breasts and wear loose-fitting clothes.
5. Perform self-massage regularly. Develop the habit of self-massaging the breasts. Use one hand to support the breast with a warm towel while the other hand massages the upper side of the breast in a clockwise direction. If the breast feels swollen or there are lumps, apply more pressure. While massaging, gently squeeze the breast to expel milk, repeat several times until the milk ducts are clear. Ideally, massage once daily for 15-20 minutes.
6. Limit consumption of irritant foods, such as onions, ginger, and garlic. Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that acute mastitis results from internal heat accumulation and toxic heat obstruction. Therefore, it's advised to avoid hot-natured foods to prevent furunculosis.
7. Food and herbal prevention. Regularly consume kelp, which softens and disperses masses, either in a cold salad or stewed with chicken, to prevent acute mastitis. For pre-symptoms of acute mastitis, consume a decoction of 30g dandelion and 6g dried tangerine peel daily."
"Abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, hematochezia, abdominal tenderness, muscular tension",Ischemic Colitis,"The treatment of ischemic colitis primarily involves managing the underlying condition. If cardiac function is normal, medications causing mesenteric vascular constriction such as digitalis and vasopressin should be withdrawn if possible.

For middle-aged and elderly patients with no clear contraindication to certain medications, drugs like Compound Danshen Tablets, which improve microcirculation, can be administered. Moreover, for patients who have developed severe intestinal dysfunction, symptomatic treatments should be actively pursued. For those with colonic distention, intestinal decompression or nasogastric suction may be employed; antiemetic drugs and gastrointestinal motility agents are recommended for nausea and vomiting; and intestinal mucosa protectants like Smecta and bismuth subcarbonate formulations are advised for diarrhea. Antispasmodics such as atropine and scopolamine, as well as opiate drugs such as diphenoxylate and loperamide, may reduce intestinal motility.

Corticosteroids are not recommended for the recovery of ischemic lesions and might increase the risk of intestinal perforation. While most patients improve with medical treatment, a small number may experience worsening conditions leading to intestinal necrosis, necessitating emergency surgery for early resection of the necrotic bowel sections."
"Papules, cold sweating, exogenous squamous epithelial wart-like hyperplasia",Syringoma,"Treatment options for syringoma include several methods: 1. Protein coagulation method, involving three steps: a) Use of Niuhuang Jing (Syringoma Anqing Ling) for cold protein coagulation therapy primarily conducted by physicians or cosmeticians. b) Consumption of Chinese herbal medicine Yinhua Baidutang to remove heat toxins, soothe the liver and regulate qi, relax meridians and invigorate blood, enhance physical strength, and regulate endocrine. c) External use of Niuhuang Qingdetox cream and Niuhuang dermatitis spirit to prevent skin infection and accelerate the healing process. 2. External use combination for syringoma, a selection of Chinese medicine treatment including ingredients such as stiff silkworm, centipede, processed aconite, Wulingzhi, Paeonia lactiflora, Lithospermum erythrorhizon, earthworm, Zaocys, Spatholobus suberectus, Pentaphylloides fruticosa, Angelica sinensis, and Panax notoginseng. It has the effects of removing decay, clearing heat and detoxifying, softening lumps and dispersing masses. Alternatively, use 30 grams of Ganodermataceae and Hericium erinaceus with water decoction. One course of treatment lasts for 3 months. 3. Intelligent molecular therapy aims to remove the tumor while minimizing damage to normal skin cells. It uses the selective adsorption of tumor cells to certain medications, targeting Syringoma cells without affecting normal skin. This method prevents scarring and is considered the premier choice for treating syringoma. 4. Microneedle therapy, also known as microneedle introduction or microneedle cosmetic treatment, has been broadly applied in the aesthetic treatments for acne and freckles. However, its efficacy specifically for syringoma treatment remains unconfirmed. The principle involves using a microneedle to quickly introduce a coagulant into the base of the syringoma through a micro-entry, preventing scar formation while treating contiguous lesions. 5. Dermal acupuncture therapy."
"Enlarged male breasts, breast lumps, breast hardening, breast pain and swelling, breast hypertrophy",Gynecomastia,"The treatment modalities for gynecomastia include: 
For physiologic cases, most resolve spontaneously and generally do not require treatment. Drug-induced cases subside once the medication is discontinued. For pathologic cases, treatment focuses on the underlying primary disease. Potential treatments include: 
1. Pharmacological Treatment: 
    a. Tamoxifen: An estrogen receptor antagonist, effective for estrogen receptor-positive cases. The dosage is 10mg per administration, twice daily. After clinical cure, the dosage is reduced to 5mg, twice daily, for a maintenance period of 0.5 to 1 month. 
    b. Danazol: Taken orally at 0.2 to 0.3g per administration, twice daily, it can alleviate the pain and severity of breast enlargement. 
    c. Clomiphene: Starting with 50mg/day, followed by 50mg every other day orally. It is discontinued if ineffective within 8 weeks. Its mechanism may involve stimulating the pituitary gland to secrete LH, improving testicular function, and directly antagonizing estrogen receptors. 
    d. Androgen Therapy: Beneficial for those with androgen deficiency, but often unsuccessful due to the conversion of androgens to estrogen in the body. Testosterone propionate is administered intramuscularly at 25–50mg, 2–3 times a week. Methyltestosterone is no longer used due to hepatotoxicity. Non-aromatizable androgens such as dihydrotestosterone can be tried. 
    e. Aromatase Inhibitors: Inhibit the aromatization of androgens in the body, thereby reducing the production of estrogen. 
2. Surgical Treatment: For cases where the male breasts are overly large or painful causing psychological distress, and pharmacological treatment is ineffective, or when a tumor is suspected, subcutaneous mastectomy through a periareolar incision can be performed, albeit potential postoperative complications include nipple retraction or distortion along with reduced sensation and conspicuous scarring. Liposuction surgery can be an option for treating gynecomastia, as it is straightforward with natural postoperative breast contour, and minimal and concealed scarring."
"Hemoptysis, coughing phlegm, cough, fever, ear pain, mucosal damage, hemorrhagic necrosis, coughing up brownish sputum plugs",Aspergillosis,"What are the treatment methods for Aspergillosis? 
  1.Antifungal Medications: 
    (1)Amphotericin B: This is the most effective drug for treating aspergillosis infections. It can be used systemically or locally. However, Amphotericin B has significant toxic effects. 
    (2)Liposomal Amphotericin B: A new formulation of Amphotericin B, its toxicity is only 1/70th of that of Amphotericin B. Administration: Dilute liposomal Amphotericin B with 5% glucose solution further to 0.2–2mg/ml, administer via a blood transfusion filter to avoid light for IV infusion, complete within 6 hours. The dosage can start at 0.3mg/kg body weight, gradually increase, with a total amount of up to 5–8g, one treatment cycle lasts 8–12 weeks. 
    (3)Itraconazole: The commonly used dose is 200–400mg/d orally, for a treatment course of 3–8 months. Main adverse reactions include gastrointestinal discomfort, dizziness, rash, somnolence, etc., with liver damage being rare. 
  2.Surgical Treatment Indications for surgery: (i) patients with a simple aspergilloma; (ii) patients with a complex aspergilloma and the primary disease requires surgical treatment; (iii) diagnostic uncertainty where purulent lung disease or lung tumor cannot be ruled out; (iv) pulmonary aspergilloma accompanied by recurrent massive hemoptysis due to chronic tuberculous cavities, which is an absolute indication for surgery. Removal of the lesion followed by antifungal medication can consolidate the treatment effect."
"Cyanosis in areas rich in capillaries such as lips, fingertips/toes, earlobes, nose tip, and oral mucosa, headache, dizziness, rapid and deepened breathing, fainting, convulsions",Tetralogy of Fallot,"The treatment measures for Tetralogy of Fallot include: 
1. General care: Regular hydration, infection prevention, timely fluid replenishment, and complication prevention are recommended. Infants and young children should receive special care to prevent episodes of hypoxic attacks. 
2. Treatment of hypoxic attacks: For mild episodes, the knee-chest position can alleviate symptoms. In severe cases, immediate oxygen therapy should be administered, along with intravenous administration of propranolol (Inderal) at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, or adrenaline (epinephrine) at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg. If necessary, subcutaneous injection of morphine at 0.1～0.2 mg/kg can be considered. Acidosis should be corrected with an intravenous injection of 5% sodium bicarbonate at 1.5～5.0 ml/kg. For patients with frequent hypoxic episodes, oral administration of propranolol (Inderal) at 1～3 mg/(kg·d) is advisable. Anemia and infections should be managed to remove causes of hypoxic attacks, and the child should be kept calm. If episodes cannot be adequately controlled, emergency surgical repair should be considered. 
3. Surgical treatment: Recent advances in surgery have continuously reduced the mortality rate associated with corrective surgery for this condition. Mild cases may undergo elective repair surgery between the ages of 5 and 9, while more severe cases should undergo corrective surgery as early as possible. Infants and very young children may initially undergo palliative shunt procedures. For severe cases, a palliative operation is also advisable, followed by corrective surgery once the child is older and pulmonary vascular development has improved. Common palliative procedures include the Blalock-Taussig shunt (subclavian artery to pulmonary artery anastomosis) and the Glenn procedure (superior vena cava to right pulmonary artery anastomosis). 
A) Indications for surgery: Clinical symptoms are mild, and corrective surgery can be deferred until the age of 5. In infancy, if hypoxia is severe, repeated respiratory infections or syncope occur, palliative shunt procedures can be performed as a temporary measure until the child grows older for corrective surgery. 
B) Surgical techniques 
I) Shunt procedures: Aim to increase pulmonary blood flow and improve oxygenation. Common procedures include: ① Blalock-Taussig shunt: Suitable for young children; microvascular surgery techniques can also be employed if applicable. ② Aortopulmonary shunt: Suitable for infants with too small subclavian arteries. A side-to-side anastomosis is created between the lateral wall of the ascending aorta and the anterior wall of the right pulmonary artery, or between the descending aorta and the left pulmonary artery, to divert blood flow directly to the pulmonary artery. 
II) Corrective surgery: Should be the treatment of choice when possible. If the left ventricle is too small, with a volume <25ml/m2, or the sum of the diameters of the left and right pulmonary arteries is smaller than the diameter of the descending aorta at the level of the diaphragm, the patient may not tolerate the surgery. After establishing cardiopulmonary bypass, the anterior wall of the right ventricle is incised, and muscle bundles or fibromuscular rings are removed to expose ventricular septal defects. These are repaired with Dacron patches, avoiding damage to the conducting bundle. To address pulmonary valve stenosis: Valvotomy can be performed; infundibular stenosis requires resection of localized hypertrophic fibromuscular tissue, often necessitating enlargement and repair of the outflow tract with pericardium or fabric. If pulmonary valve annulus or main pulmonary artery stenosis is present and measures <1cm in diameter in children or <1.5cm in adults, it should be longitudinally incised and enlarged with a suitable size of pericardial patch or Dacron patch to expand the right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary artery. Post-surgery, symptoms can significantly improve or disappear, and normal physical development and activity levels can be restored. Low cardiac output syndrome is often a severe postoperative complication and a major cause of mortality."
"Increased intracranial pressure, neurological deficits",Glioma,"The treatment modalities for gliomas are primarily surgical. However, due to the tumor's infiltrative growth and the lack of a clear boundary between the tumor and brain tissue, complete resection is difficult except in early cases where the tumor is small and located in an optimal position. Comprehensive treatment is generally advocated, which includes postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy to delay recurrence and extend survival. Early diagnosis and timely treatment are crucial for improving treatment outcomes. Surgery becomes more challenging and risky in the later stages, often resulting in residual neurological deficits. High-grade tumors, in particular, are prone to rapid recurrence.
Surgical treatment aims to remove the tumor as much as possible while preserving neurological functions. For early-stage small tumors, complete resection should be attempted. For superficial tumors, the cortex around the tumor is incised, and for white matter tumors located away from important functional areas, cortical incisions should be made at a distance. When separating the tumor, it should be done within normal brain tissue, not closely following the tumor borders. Particularly in more benign tumors such as astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas located in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe anterior part, or cerebellar hemisphere, better therapeutic effects can be achieved.
For larger tumors located in the frontal or temporal lobes, a lobectomy can be performed to remove the tumor. In the frontal lobe, the incision's posterior edge should be at least 2cm in front of the precentral sulcus, avoiding the motor speech center in the dominant hemisphere. In the temporal lobe, the posterior edge should be before the inferior anastomotic vein, avoiding damage to the lateral fissure's vessels. Some tumors located in the occipital lobe can also undergo lobectomy but might result in homonymous hemianopia. If a frontal or temporal lobe tumor cannot be completely resected, as much of the tumor should be removed as possible, along with polar decompression to prolong the recurrence time.
Tumors affecting more than two lobes of the cerebral hemisphere with contralateral hemiplegia, but not invading the basal ganglia and thalamus, can be treated with hemispherectomy.
For tumors in the motor and speech areas without significant hemiplegia or aphasia, it's important to appropriately remove the tumor while preserving neurological functions, avoiding severe sequela. Subtemporal or subtemporal decompressive craniectomy can also be performed. Biopsy followed by decompression surgery is an option. For thalamic tumors causing third ventricle obstruction, a shunt operation can be performed, otherwise, decompression can be undertaken.
Ventricular tumors can be accessed through non-essential functional areas of the brain tissue to reach the ventricles, aiming to remove the tumor as much as possible and relieve ventricular obstruction. Care should be taken to avoid damaging the tumor adjacent to the hypothalamus or brainstem to prevent hazards. For brainstem tumors, small nodular or cystic ones can be resected; those with increased intracranial pressure can undergo shunting. Tumors in the vermis are difficult to resect and can also be treated with shunting.
In critical conditions, supratentorial tumors should first be treated with diuretics while pursuing rapid diagnosis and surgical treatment. Posterior fossa tumors can initially undergo ventricular drainage surgery, followed by surgical treatment after 2-3 days when the condition stabilizes.
Radiotherapy: High-voltage X-ray therapy machines, 60Co therapy machines, and electron accelerators are external radiation sources used. The latter two are high-energy rays with strong penetration, low skin dosage, and minimal bone absorption. The accelerator's dose concentrates on the anticipated depth, drastically decreasing beyond this depth, protecting the normal brain tissue behind the lesion. Radiotherapy should begin as soon as the general condition recovers after surgery. The standard dose for gliomas is 5000-6000cGy over 5-6 weeks. For tumors with high sensitivity to radiotherapy, such as medulloblastomas, a dose of 4000-5000cGy is recommended.
Various types of gliomas have different sensitivities to radiotherapy. Generally, poorly differentiated tumors are more sensitive than well-differentiated ones. Medulloblastomas are highly sensitive to radiotherapy, followed by ependymoblastomas, with polymorphic glioblastomas being moderately sensitive, whereas astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and pineal cell tumors are less sensitive. Medulloblastomas and ependymomas, prone to cerebrospinal fluid dissemination, should include whole spinal column irradiation.
Chemotherapy: Highly lipophilic chemotherapeutic drugs that can cross the blood-brain barrier are suitable for treating brain gliomas. For grade III-IV astrocytomas, the blood-brain barrier is disrupted due to edema, allowing hydrophilic large molecules to pass through. However, in densely proliferating areas around the tumor, the disruption of the blood-brain barrier is not significant. Therefore, lipophilic drugs should be primarily chosen. The following drugs are currently preferred:
1. Teniposide: A semi-synthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin with a molecular weight of 656.7, known commercially as Vumon (teniposide, VM26). It is a cell-cycle-specific drug that damages deoxyribonucleic acid, blocking the G2 (late DNA synthesis) and M (mitotic) phases. VM26 is most toxic to tumor cells (70%-98%) and least toxic to normal cells (28%-38%). The common dosage for adults is 120-200mg/m2 per day for 2-6 days. When combined with CCNU, the dosage can be reduced to 60mg/m2 per day, administered in a 10% glucose solution (250ml) intravenous drip for about 1.5 hours over 2 days, followed by oral CCNU for 2 days on the 3rd and 4th days, constituting one treatment cycle. This cycle is repeated every 6 weeks. Side effects: It has mild bone marrow suppression and lower toxicity; cardiovascular reactions manifest as hypotension, hence blood pressure should be monitored during the drip.
2. Lomustine (CCNU): This cell-cycle-specific drug has been in clinical use for many years, acting on proliferating cells' various phases and resting phase cells. Its strong lipophilicity allows it to cross the blood-brain barrier, making it a choice for treating malignant brain gliomas. The toxicity reaction is significant, primarily manifesting as delayed bone marrow suppression and cumulative reaction, significantly limiting its use. After 4-5 treatment cycles, a marked decrease in white blood cells and platelets necessitates postponing or even interrupting treatment, leading to relapse. In addition, it severely affects the gastrointestinal tract, with a high percentage of patients experiencing nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain after taking the drug. The liver and lungs are also affected. The common dosage for adults is 100-130mg/m2 taken orally for 1-2 days, repeated every 4-6 days. Currently, the dosage can be reduced to 60mg/m2 when combined with VM26.
3. Semustine (MeCCNU): The dosage is 170-225mg/m2. The administration is the same as CCNU, but the toxicity is lower.
Chemotherapy for gliomas tends to use combination drugs, based on cell kinetics and the drugs' specificity for cell cycles, using two or more drugs, even multiple drugs in combination, to improve efficacy. Shangha's Zhang Tianxi's sequential chemotherapy with teniposide and lomustine shows significant efficacy and is recommended. The procedure is as follows: Each cycle lasts for 4 days. On the first and second days: 100mg of VM26 is added to a 10% glucose solution (250ml) for a 1.5-2 hour intravenous drip, continued for 2 days. Rapid infusion or direct injection of VM26 may cause a sudden drop in blood pressure, which should be avoided. Blood pressure should be monitored during the drip to prevent accidents. Considering that VM26 diluted in room temperature becomes ineffective after 4 hours, it should be prepared immediately before use. On the third and fourth days: 80mg of CC-NU is taken orally each day. Antiemetics such as metoclopramide should be given half an hour before taking the drug to reduce gastrointestinal reactions. After one treatment cycle ends, the next cycle is repeated every 6 weeks. Generally, the effect of CCNU peaks in the fourth week, hence, a routine blood count of white blood cells and platelets is recommended at the end of the fifth week. If the white blood cell count is below 3×109/L and the platelet count is below 90×109/L, chemotherapy should be postponed until the blood count recovers before starting the next cycle. Due to the cumulative toxicity of CCNU, usually, after 4-5 cycles, it's difficult to maintain the blood count, and the interval may have to be extended. VM26 can be used alone as a transition until the blood count improves before resuming the combination of the two drugs. During this period, routine support treatments such as DNA and squalene can be given. If the patient tolerates well, 10-15 cycles can be continuous. If CT scans show no signs of recurrence and clinical manifestations are satisfactory, treatment may be finally discontinued for follow-up.
Immunotherapy: Immunotherapy is still in the experimental stage, and its efficacy is uncertain, requiring further research.
Other drug treatments: For malignant gliomas, steroids can be given before surgical treatment, with dexamethasone being the most effective. Besides reducing cerebral edema, it also inhibits tumor cell growth, alleviating symptoms before proceeding with surgical treatment.
For patients with seizures, antiepileptic drugs should be given before and after surgery."
"Abnormal gait or falling, inability to start moving after standing still, difficulty climbing stairs",Congenital Myotonia,"What are the treatment methods for Congenital Myotonia?
 (1) Management and Treatment

 It should be explained to parents that this condition is benign, but has a long course requiring patience. Mild cases may not significantly impact daily life and may not require special treatment. Quinine and Procainamide are effective in relieving myotonia for several hours. Additionally, Phenytoin and Prednisone (Deltacortril) also show efficacy to some degree. For symptoms severely affecting daily life and learning, the following treatment approaches primarily aim at symptomatic treatment:

 1. Quinine, acting similar to curare, lowers the excitability at the neuromuscular junction, inhibits the release of acetylcholine, extends the muscle contraction latent period, and stabilizes the muscle membrane. It is commonly used in treating myotonia. The dosage for children is 0.1～0.3g orally, 2 to 3 times a day. Side effects to watch for include tinnitus, deafness, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, and optic nerve atrophy.

 2. Phenytoin helps stabilize the muscle membrane, reduce membrane excitability, and decrease sodium ion inflow into cells. The pediatric dosage is 3～8mg/(kg·d), taken orally in three divided doses. Its side effects include tremors, gum hypertrophy, and ataxia.

 3. Procainamide decreases the excitability of the neuromuscular junction and stabilizes the muscle membrane. The pediatric dosage is 14mg/kg every 6 hours. Overdosing can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, chills, fever, muscle pain, rash, arrhythmias, agranulocytosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

 4. Corticosteroids or ACTH help promote the excretion of potassium ions, lowering the sensitivity of muscle cells to potassium ions. Prednisone can be given at 1～2mg/(kg·d) in a single dose, or Dexamethasone at 0.1～0.2mg/(kg·d) by intravenous drip, reducing the dose after symptoms improve; or ACTH at 0.5～1U/kg, twice a day by intramuscular injection.

 5. Other medications like Acetazolamide, Nifedipine, and Diazepam (Valium) can also be used.

 (2) Prognosis

 The majority of cases of this disease do not progress, hence the prognosis is good. The severity of myotonia may decrease with age. Although the symptoms of myotonia may be hard to eliminate completely, patients can still engage in general work. Some patients may experience muscle atrophy or show signs of myotonic malnutrition."
"Erythematous papules, pustular papules, intense pruritus, erosion, lymphadenopathy, fever, erythema, desquamation, fissured scratch marks, crusted scabs, infantile crying, restless sleep, skin erythema, yellow greasy scales, seborrheic crusts, exudation",Seborrheic Dermatitis,"Treatments for Seborrheic Dermatitis include: 
Traditional Chinese Medicine approaches: 
(1) Apply a mixture of 30g Phellodendron bark powder, 15g Gypsum powder, and 3g Indigo naturalis powder with sesame oil to the affected area twice daily. 
(2) Mix 30g Coptis chinensis and 15g Alum powder into fine powder, then add sufficient Vaseline to form an ointment for application. 
(3) Brew a decoction with 30g Cortex Dictamni and 60g fresh Ligustrum leaves, use it to wash the affected area when lukewarm, then apply a finely ground powder mixture of 15g Phellodendron amurense, 30g Indigo naturalis, 30g raw Rheum officinale, 30g Pine pollen, and 9g Alum after drying. Apply twice daily for 3-5 days for potential cure. 
(4) Boil 12g each of Rhubarb, Kudzu root, Phellodendron bark, Sophora flavescens, and Xanthium strumarium in water, and wash the affected area three times a day, each time for 15 minutes. Add 15g of Alum if exudation is heavy. 
(5) Boil 30g of tea leaves in water and apply hot to the affected area, then apply the boiled leaves on the eczema, 2-3 times a day, suitable for wet eczema with red swelling and ulceration. 
(6) Boil appropriate amount of stiff silkworms, ground after removing the mouthparts, in water and wash the affected area once a day or once every two days. 
Western medicine approaches: 
(1) Internal treatment such as Mycostatin tablets along with oral intake of compound Vitamin B, ketoconazole, griseofulvin, 0.2% diphenhydramine syrup (1-2 mg/kg/day, divided into 3-4 doses), and promethazine (0.35 mg/kg/day, divided into 3-4 doses). 
(2) Topical treatment options include Compound Resorcinol liniment, Glacial Acetic Acid solution, Salicylic Alcohol, Clotrimazole cream, Sertaconazole cream, antiperspirant, Compound Benzoic Acid ointment, Sodium Sulfate, Whitfield's Ointment, Bifonazole Cream, 11-propenoic acid medicated water, Laurocapram Alcohol, and others. 
(3) In-home treatments include 3% Boric Acid solution for weepy lesions followed by Zinc Oxide oil, and then Zinc Borate paste as the exudate reduces, applied 2-3 times daily. For dry types, apply 2-5% Black Bean distillate or Coal Tar ointment, or hydrocortisone and soothing skin ointments, 2-3 times daily. 
Ultraviolet light therapy, once a day for 20-30 minutes."
"The skin lesions initially appear as small patches of redness, follicular papules, or pustules with hairs passing through the center. The hair becomes loose and can be plucked out. Once the vesicles burst, they reveal a red, eroded surface. Pustules can merge into patches, dry up, and form dirty yellow crusts. Scarring may remain after healing.",Barber's Itch,"Therapeutic approaches for treating lupoid sycosis include systemic treatment with appropriate antibiotics, especially for cases involving seborrheic dermatitis which require active treatment. Physiotherapy or superficial X-ray irradiation may be considered. Local treatment involves hot compresses with a 1:5000 potassium permanganate solution applied 2-3 times a day, followed by antibiotic ointment or cleanser for subacute cases. Traditional Chinese Medicine suggests internal administration of Longdan Xiegan Pills or Zhizi Jinhua Pills and topical application of a mixture of 10% Realgar Jiedu Powder and Huanglian Ointment. Prognosis indicates that purulent follicular orifices heal leaving atrophic scars, leading to follicular destruction and hair loss. The disease course is slow, often chronic, and resistant to treatment."
"Paroxysmal sneezing, watery rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itchiness",Allergic Rhinitis,"Treatment options for allergic rhinitis include: 
1. Allergen avoidance: 
  (1) Reduce indoor dust mites; maintain indoor relative humidity below 60%, but not too low (below 30%–40%) to avoid discomfort; clean carpets; wash bedding and curtains, as mite allergens are water-soluble and most allergens can be removed by washing textiles; use air purifiers and vacuum cleaners with filters. 
  (2) Avoid allergens during the corresponding pollen season. 
  (3) For patients allergic to animal fur, avoid exposure to these allergens. 
2. Pharmacotherapy: 
  Consider factors such as efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Intranasal and oral medications are commonly used, with variable effects among patients. There is no long-term efficacy after discontinuation, hence continuous management is necessary for persistent allergic rhinitis. Treatment extension does not lead to rapid drug resistance. Intranasal administration has many advantages, allowing for high concentration of medication to be applied directly to the nasal area, minimizing systemic side effects. For patients with other allergic diseases, systemic drug treatments are recommended over intranasal medications. Pregnant patients should use caution with all medications. 
  (1) Second-generation or newer oral or nasal H1 antihistamines can effectively alleviate symptoms such as nasal itching, sneezing, and rhinorrhea. Suitable for mild intermittent and mild persistent allergic rhinitis, or combined with intranasal corticosteroids for the treatment of moderate to severe allergic rhinitis. 
  (2) Intranasal corticosteroids effectively relieve symptoms like nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing. For severe patients who do not respond to or cannot tolerate nasal drugs, short-term treatment with oral corticosteroids is an option. 
  (3) Leukotriene receptor antagonists are effective for allergic rhinitis and asthma. 
  (4) Chromones have some effectiveness in relieving nasal symptoms, with eye drops effective in alleviating ocular symptoms. 
  (5) Nasal decongestants can alleviate symptoms of nasal congestion but should be limited to durations less than 7 days. 
  (6) Intranasal anticholinergic drugs can effectively inhibit rhinorrhea. 
  (7) Certain traditional Chinese medicines are effective in relieving symptoms. Treatment principles for children and the elderly are similar to adults, but special attention should be given to avoid adverse drug reactions. 
3. Immunotherapy: 
  Immunotherapy induces clinical and immunological tolerance with long-term effects and can prevent the development of allergic diseases. Allergen-specific immunotherapy commonly utilizes subcutaneous injections and sublingual administration. Treatment phases include dose accumulation and maintenance, spanning no less than 2 years with standardized allergen vaccines. 
  (1) Indications mainly include patients with allergic rhinitis unresponsive to conventional drug treatments. 
  (2) Contraindications include active phase asthma; use of beta-blockers; concurrent autoimmune diseases; pregnant women; patients unable to comprehend the risks and limitations of treatment. 
Local and systemic adverse reactions may occur. 
4. Surgical treatment: 
  Indications include unimproved nasal congestion symptoms after medication or immunotherapy, significant signs affecting quality of life, significant anatomical variations in the nasal cavity with functional impairment, and concurrent chronic rhinosinusitis or nasal polyps unresponsive to medication. Surgical treatment is not considered a routine approach for managing allergic rhinitis."
"Visual impairment, metamorphopsia, fundus changes, retinal detachment, fundus hemorrhage, and exudation",Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC),"The treatment options for Central Serous Chorioretinopathy are diverse due to its unknown etiology and complex pathogenesis, making effective treatment challenging. Treatment is determined by the severity and characteristics of the condition, primarily involving the following approaches:
1. Western Medicine: This includes the use of antibiotics, sulfonamide drugs, and various vitamins for systemic diseases, combined with vasodilators to relieve arteriolar spasms, improve microcirculation, and enhance tissue oxygen tolerance. Commonly used medications include rutin, vitamin C, and B vitamins. Calcium supplements may be used to reduce capillary hemorrhage. Late-stage treatments may include intramuscular injections of anbiodol, though their effectiveness is limited.
2. Traditional Chinese Medicine: Alongside Western treatments, Chinese herbal medicine is recommended to enhance efficacy. Different treatment methods are proposed based on syndrome differentiation and disease identification, including:
- Liver Qi Stagnation Type: Treatment involves soothing the liver and relieving depression, clearing heat and cooling blood. A modified Xiaoyao Powder is used.
- Yin Deficiency and Excessive Fire Type: Treatment focuses on nourishing yin, reducing fire, activating blood, and removing blood stasis. Modified Zhibai Dihuang Decoction along with blood-activating and stasis-removing herbs are recommended.
- Spleen Deficiency and Qi Weakness Type: The treatment goal is to nourish the heart and spleen, activate blood, and remove stasis. Modified Shenling Baizhu Powder and Guipi Decoction are used.
Additionally, acupuncture may improve Qi flow, promote blood circulation, and speed up the absorption of hemorrhage, reducing complications. Specific acupoints are selected based on the underlying imbalances.
3. Laser Therapy: Fluorescein angiography often reveals neovascularization preceding hemorrhage. Laser therapy, particularly when new blood vessels are located outside the peripapillary and macular bundles, is observed to be most effective. However, its application must be considered carefully, especially in active phases of the disease. There's debate over the type of laser, wavelength, energy level, and spot size, with some preferring pure green light from argon lasers and others advocating for better outcomes with krypton red laser in treating choroidal neovascularization near the fovea.
4. Surgical Treatment: As CSC lacks specific pharmacological control and given the limitations of laser therapy, including high recurrence rates of subretinal neovascularization (SRNV) and difficulties in treating SRNV with overlying hemorrhage, surgical interventions targeting SRNV and hemorrhage have been explored, though indications for surgery vary among researchers."
"Intellectual disability, port-wine stains, vascular malformations, absence seizures in epilepsy, iris defects, lens opacity, hemianopia, hemiatrophy, hemiplegia",Sturge-Weber Syndrome,"What are the treatment options for Sturge-Weber Syndrome? 

Treatment: 
Patients suspected of having Sturge-Weber Syndrome should be thoroughly examined. Examination of the patient's family members can aid in diagnosis. When examining the eyes of such infants under general anesthesia, anesthesiologists should be highly cautious due to the frequent occurrence of epilepsy in these patients. Neurological, pediatric, and skull X-ray examinations are necessary. In cases of glaucoma occurring in infancy, goniotomy may be performed initially; if intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled, trabeculectomy may be considered. For patients developing the condition in childhood, medical treatment should be attempted first, and if intraocular pressure cannot be managed, goniotomy or trabeculectomy should be considered. Goniotomy, despite its lower success rate, is often preferred as the first surgical option; filtration surgery, while having a higher success rate, tends to have more severe complications. Thus, when considering filtration surgery for this syndrome, the potential surgical complications must be vigilantly monitored. Sudden drops in intraocular pressure following the creation of an opening in the anterior chamber can lead to choroidal vessel dilation, exudation, hemorrhage, and retinal detachment, with postoperative shallow anterior chamber or no anterior chamber frequently occurring. In such cases, it becomes challenging to restore the anterior chamber through medication and further surgery; therefore, hyperosmotic agents should be employed preoperatively to lower intraocular pressure as much as possible, and a posterior sclerotomy may be performed initially during surgery to release a small amount of vitreous, aiming to minimize or mitigate these complications. 

If neither filtration surgery nor medical treatment can control the intraocular pressure, cyclophotocoagulation may be considered. Generally, both medical and surgical treatments for this type of glaucoma tend to have poor outcomes. 

Prognosis: 
The outcomes of surgery are generally poor."
"Skin ulceration, pustules formation",Keratosis Pilaris,"The treatment options for Keratosis Pilaris include oral retinoids or vitamin A derivatives. Topically, options comprise 3% to 5% salicylic acid and resorcinol (Synalar) ointment, 30% cod liver oil ointment, 0.1% tretinoin cream, or 10% to 20% urea cream. Ultraviolet light therapy can also alleviate symptoms. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) approaches focus on nourishing blood, moisturizing yin to relieve dryness, utilizing prescriptions like Siwu Tang, Heshouwu Tang, Runfu Tang, or Wenjing Tang with added Coix Seed."
"Fever, rash, pustules, edema, nodules, ulcers",Pyoderma Gangrenosum,"Once a diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum is confirmed, treatment should commence immediately with high doses of oral corticosteroids, typically 1-3 mg/kg, or pulsed methylprednisolone therapy: 1g/d for 5 days, combined with 150ml of 5% glucose solution for intravenous infusion over 1 hour. Additional treatments can include Salazopyrin, sulfapyridine, or cytotoxic drugs. Salazopyrin acts as an antibiotic, immunosuppressant, and anti-prostaglandin, administered in doses of 4-6g/d. Intralesional injections of dexamethasone may vary in effectiveness. Synthetic resin dressings may be applied over drainage areas. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy can help alleviate pain and accelerate healing. There have been successes with potassium iodide treatment. Pentoxifylline, with its anti-TNF action, is also an option. For patients with concomitant diseases, specific treatments are necessary, including melphalan for multiple myeloma. Cyclosporin may be used at 10mg/kg/d. Chlorpromazine 200-400mg/d can be effective in controlling the condition. In the absence of secondary infection, topical treatments should be gentle and symptomatic. Colostomy in cases with intestinal disease generally proves ineffective. Minocycline 100mg twice daily can be particularly effective in subacute cases. Intravenous immunoglobulin, once popular 30 years ago, has been adopted again in recent treatments."
"Cough, expectoration, hemoptysis",Aspergillosis,"Treatment strategies for Aspergillosis include:

1. Strict control over the use of corticosteroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Aggressive treatment of the primary disease, strengthening of supportive therapy, and enhancement of the body's immune system.

3. Etiological treatment:

  (1) For patients with Cryptococcal meningitis:
    i. Amphotericin B in combination with 5-Flucytosine exhibits a synergistic effect. Amphotericin B should be administered as an IV drip at a dosage of 1mg/(kg·d), and 5-Flucytosine at 50-150mg/(kg·d) orally or via IV in three divided doses for a total of 6 weeks. Kidney function and complete blood count should be checked every 2 weeks during treatment to determine the appropriate dosing interval. Caution is advised in patients with renal impairment or bone marrow suppression (The initial dose of Amphotericin B for IV infusion is 0.1mg/(kg·d), gradually increasing by 0.05-0.1mg/kg daily up to 1.0mg/kg, without exceeding 50mg/d; the drug should be dissolved in 5% glucose solution at the optimal concentration of 0.1mg/ml). Amphotericin B can also be used in combination with Rifampin for a synergistic effect.
    ii. Miconazole (Dichlorobenzyl Imidazole) is often used for patients who are intolerant to Amphotericin B or when treatment response is poor. Effective against systemic infections by Candida, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, or Coccidioides. Dosage: 0.6g-1.2g/d via IV in three divided doses, intrathecal injection for adults 20mg every 3-7 days.
    iii. Fluconazole has a broad-spectrum antifungal action, is well-absorbed orally, can cross the blood-brain barrier, and is administered at 200mg once or twice daily.
    iv. Erythromycin: Oral administration of 400-2000U/(kg·d), initial IV drip at 40-100U/(kg·d); gradually increasing to 600-800U/(kg·d), with a total adult dosage not exceeding 3-4 million U.

  (2) Mild pulmonary cryptococcosis patients may not require antifungal medication, if follow-up conditions are absent, oral administration of Ketoconazole 200mg-400mg/d is an option.

4. Nursing:

  (1) General infectious disease nursing routine, with additional care routines for high fevers.

  (2) Timely submission of sputum, blood, urine, feces, cerebrospinal fluid, pus, etc., for routine examination and culture.

  (3) Close observation of the patient's condition, paying special attention to symptoms such as cough, hemoptysis, respiratory changes, and changes in consciousness, and contact the physician promptly if there are any changes.

  (4) Promptly perform isolation, air disinfection, oral hygiene, and skin care.

5. Discharge criteria:

Clinical symptoms and signs disappear, mental state and appetite recover, routine blood and cerebrospinal fluid tests return to normal, cultures are negative."
"Deep headache, sluggish reaction, brainstem hemorrhage, brainstem lesions, periaqueductal damage, strabismus, facial muscle twitching, ataxia, ventricular compression shift, hypothalamic damage, pharyngeal paresthesia, cervical edema",Glioma,"What are the treatment options for glioma? 1. For those who are unsuitable for surgery and difficult to diagnose, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) conservative treatment can be considered. TCM aims to balance Yin and Yang, Qi and blood, and the functions of internal organs, reinforcing the body's strengths and eliminating its weaknesses, which may alleviate clinical symptoms and prolong the patient's lifespan. Regular follow-ups for suspected glioma cases play a key role in proactive defense. 2. Postoperative care is critical as a variety of symptoms might occur after cranial surgery, such as cerebral edema, fever, indigestion, hiccups, and abnormal urination. TCM treatment, by clearing damp-heat, promoting spleen and stomach function, reducing reverse flow and warming Yang to transform Qi, facilitates postoperative recovery. 3. Postoperative treatment can effectively prevent recurrence. Given the brain's unique structure, it's challenging to fully excise the tumor, leading to a higher probability of recurrence. Besides selective radiotherapy and chemotherapy, long-term postoperative TCM treatment following syndrome differentiation may reduce the recurrence of glioma. 4. TCM can mitigate side effects caused by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, such as nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, hair loss, rough and peeling skin, insomnia, or somnolence. TCM improves the condition of leukopenia caused by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, enhancing overall symptoms caused by decreased white blood cells, thereby helping patients complete the course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy and achieve the anticipated outcomes. 5. Patients who fear surgery, do not wish to undergo surgery due to fear of postoperative recurrence or financial concerns, can opt for TCM conservative treatment."
"Pain and swelling in the limbs and joints, temporomandibular joint pain, sacroiliac joint pain, valgus deformity of the knee",Osteoarthritis,"The primary methods of managing osteoarthritis involve reducing joint load and limiting excessive, large movements to slow the progression of the disease. Patients with obesity are advised to lose weight to lessen the load on their joints. For lower limb joint pathologies, the use of canes or walking sticks might be recommended to help alleviate the burden on the joints. Physical therapy and appropriate exercises can maintain the range of motion of the joints, and the use of splints or canes, as necessary, can help in controlling symptoms during acute phases. Anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications can reduce or control symptoms. For advanced cases, total joint replacement surgery is considered an effective method to eliminate pain, correct deformities, and improve function when the patient's overall health status can tolerate surgery. This procedure significantly enhances the quality of life for patients."
"Swelling, congestion, erosion of the prepuce and glans penis, adhesion of the prepuce, difficulty urinating, urinary retention, thin urinary stream",Phimosis,"What are the treatment methods for phimosis? 
    1. For congenital phimosis in infants and young children, the prepuce can be repeatedly attempted to be retracted to enlarge the preputial orifice. The method should be gentle to avoid forcibly retracting the prepuce. Once the glans penis is exposed, clean the smegma, apply antibiotic cream or liquid paraffin for lubrication, and then restore the prepuce to its original position to avoid paraphimosis. Most children treated in this manner will be cured as they grow older, with only a minority requiring circumcision. For paraphimosis, urgent manual reduction is necessary, and if needed, a dorsal slit of the prepuce is performed. 
    2. For patients with acquired phimosis due to fibrous narrowing of the preputial orifice, circumcision is required, with indications including: fibrotic narrowing of the preputial orifice, recurrent balanoposthitis, and preputial orifice narrowing after the age of 6. 
    3. For cases of buried penis, circumcision should be avoided, and preputioplasty should be performed instead. 
    There are varying opinions on the indications for circumcision. In some countries and regions, circumcision is commonly performed shortly after birth due to religious or cultural reasons. Some believe that circumcision can reduce the incidence of penile cancer and cervical cancer in women after marriage. However, data indicates that the incidence rates of these cancers are low in both Israel, where circumcision is common, and in Nordic countries, where circumcision is less prevalent, with no significant difference."
"Abdominal pain, bloody stool, diarrhea, tenesmus, rectal prolapse, anemia, malnutrition, right lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, low-grade fever",Trichuriasis,"Treatment options for Trichuriasis vary based on the severity of the infection. Mild to moderate infections may not require specific treatment, while severe infections should be managed with a high-protein, easily digestible diet, correction of anemia using iron supplements, and concurrent treatment with metronidazole for amoebic dysentery and antibiotics for bacterial dysentery if present.

1. Anthelmintic Therapy:
   (a) Albendazole administered as capsules or tablets in a single dose for 2 consecutive days, achieving an egg reduction rate of 43.2% to 52.7% with mild side effects. A treatment duration of 5 to 7 days is recommended for severe infections, showing no significant side effects, with rare cases of dizziness, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting of worms, or transient increase in transaminases which usually resolve on their own.
   (b) Mebendazole taken for 3 consecutive days with a cure rate of 60% to 80%. Children's dosage should be halved and treatment for severe infections can be extended to 6 days or repeated for another course with generally good tolerance and minor gastrointestinal reactions. Not recommended for pregnant women and use with caution in children under 12 years old. A combination of Mebendazole and Levamisole (Co-formulation) shows effectiveness of 80% to 83.8%.
   (c) Oxantel taken orally, offers a cure rate of 57% in a 2-day treatment or up to 100% in a 5-day treatment. Side effects are minor and transient, resolving spontaneously.
   (d) Pyrvinium-embonate and Oxantel combination in a single dose treatment for 2 days, reaching an egg-negative rate of 93.8% and is also effective against Ascaris, hookworm, and Enterobius infections.
   (e) Obendazole with a 4-week post-treatment egg re-examination showing egg-negative rates of 70.4%, 70.4%, and 53.3%.
   (f) Flubendazole administered for 2 consecutive days with a cure rate of 86%.
   (g) Niclosamide, containing Albendazole, in a single dose treatment showing egg-negative rate of 71.7% with few side effects like headache and gastrointestinal discomfort which typically disappear within 48 hours. Not suitable for children under 1 year and pregnant women.
   (h) Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment with Areca decoction and preceding administration of magnesium sulfate the night before, followed by the decoction the next morning. If no diarrheal response within 3 hours, an additional dose of magnesium sulfate is given.
   (i) Oxygen therapy involves the slow rectal infusion of 500ml oxygen 2 hours post-breakfast, followed by magnesium sulfate administration after 45 minutes. This process is repeated on the 2nd and 3rd day with increased oxygen volumes of 750ml and 1000ml, respectively. Post-infusion gentle massage of the right lower quadrant and supine rest for the patient are recommended. This method is free of side effects.

2. Fibrocolonoscopy Treatment:
   In cases of severe infection where pharmaceutical treatment fails to fully cure, endoscopic forceps retrieval can be employed to gently grasp and pull the worm bodies from the intestinal mucosa under direct visualization."
"Muscle atrophy, weakness, abnormal tendon reflexes, difficulty swallowing, sensory disturbances, speech disorders",Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS),"What are the treatment options for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)?
    Long-term, ALS has lacked effective treatment measures. Since the introduction of Riluzole as the standard treatment drug for ALS in 1995, extensive clinical validation has found that this drug can extend the time ALS patients spend in the mild to moderate stages of the disease and survival, and postpone the onset of respiratory difficulties, but it cannot improve existing motor disorders. The drug primarily acts by inhibiting the release of presynaptic glutamate, blocking excitatory amino acid receptors, and inhibiting voltage-dependent sodium channels on both nerve terminals and neuron bodies. The method of administration is 50mg, orally, twice a day, with a treatment period of 1 to 1.5 years. This medication is well tolerated, with common side effects including nausea, fatigue, and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT).
    Symptomatic treatment of ALS is significant in improving patient quality of life. Physical therapy can delay muscle atrophy progression and prevent joint contractures. For swallowing dysfunction, timely gastrostomy or gastrostomy surgery should be performed to ensure nutrient supply and avoid aspiration pneumonia caused by coughing and choking. Tracheotomy and mechanical ventilation should be performed when respiratory distress occurs. For patients with exertional dyspnea, intermittent positive pressure support ventilation can be provided; this type of ventilator is small, easy to operate, and portable, making it readily accepted by patients. For patients with painful spasms or severe spasm conditions, Carbamazepine 0.1g, three times a day, or Baclofen, starting dose of 5mg three times a day with an increase of 5mg every three days, is recommended. The effective dose range is 30-75mg, with a maximum dose of 100-120mg."
"Palpitations, shortness of breath, reduced exercise tolerance, difficulty breathing, dizziness, syncope, cough with phlegm, hemoptysis, abnormal respiration",Cardiac Myxoma,"The treatment methods for Cardiac Myxoma include: 
1. Strict bed rest; 
2. For those with heart failure, strengthen the heart and diuretics to improve heart function. Perform low-temperature extracorporeal circulation surgery as soon as possible or on an emergency basis to remove the intracardiac tumor; 
3. Avoid moving the heart and intracardiac and extracardiac exploration before clamping the aorta during surgery; 
4. Thorough resection should be done at the site of the tumor's stalk in the interatrial septum, atrial wall, endocardium, and myocardium. If cardiac valves are involved and cannot be repaired, valve replacement surgery should be performed. Valve annuloplasty should be done if annular dilatation causes insufficiency. If the resection range of the interatrial septum is large, patch repair should be performed; 
5. The cardiac incision should be large to facilitate the complete removal of the tumor; 
6. After tumor removal, the heart chamber should be thoroughly flushed to prevent tumor fragments from remaining inside the heart chamber."
"Motor dysfunction, bladder dysfunction, spinal shock, flexion myelopathy, Brown-Séquard syndrome, dizziness",Spinal Cord Injury,"What are the treatment methods for spinal cord injury? Treatment strategies include: 1) Proper immobilization to prevent secondary spinal cord injury due to displacement of the injured site. Initially, a jaw-neck brace or continuous cranial traction is generally used. 2) Reducing spinal cord edema and secondary injury through methods such as: a) Dexamethasone, 10-20mg intravenous drip, continued for 5-7 days then switched to oral administration, three times a day, 0.75mg each time, for about two weeks. b) Mannitol, 20% solution 250ml intravenous drip twice a day for 5-7 times. c) Methylprednisolone pulse therapy, a single dose of 30mg/per kg body weight, completed within 15 minutes via intravenous injection, followed by a 45-minute rest, then a continuous intravenous drip of 5.4mg/(kg·h) over the next 23 hours. This method is only used for injuries within the first 8 hours. d) Hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Animal experiments show that the best effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is within 2 hours after injury, although generally good effects can also be achieved within 4–6 hours after injury based on clinical experience. 3) Surgical treatment can only relieve compression on the spinal cord and restore the stability of the spine, currently unable to restore the function of the damaged spinal cord. The approach and method of the surgery depend on the type of fracture and the location of the compressive substance. Indications for surgery include: a) Spinal fracture, dislocation with facet joint interlocking; b) Unsatisfactory spinal fracture reduction, or presence of spinal instability; c) Imaging showing bone fragments protruding into the spinal canal compressing the spinal cord; d) Increasing level of paralysis, indicating active bleeding within the spinal canal. An MRI showing hemorrhage within the spinal cord allows for midline dorsal myelotomy to remove clots and fluid, aiding in the reduction of edema. The outcome of the surgery is difficult to predict beforehand. Generally, one can expect at least a one-level improvement in the paralysis index after surgery. For complete paralysis, an improvement of one level may not solve many problems, but for incomplete paralysis, it could mean a significant improvement in the quality of life. Hence, a more aggressive approach is advisable, especially in the case of old fractures. Other treatment methods include: 1) Physical therapy focusing on improving joint mobility and remaining muscle strength, as well as balance, coordination, and transfer movements. 2) Occupational therapy for daily living skills, vocational and craft activities, and provision of simple assistive tools for successful home living. 3) Psychological therapy based on the different psychological stages, employing individual, group, family, and behavioral methods. 4) Rehabilitation engineering, customizing necessary orthotics for standing and walking practices, and providing special aids to compensate for functional deficiencies. 5) Clinical rehabilitation using special care and drugs like vitamin A, C/E, strong bone capsules, calcium tablets, etc., to prevent complications and promote functional recovery. 6) Cultural and sports rehabilitation through entertainment and sports for comprehensive training and wheelchair training, and for preparing social activities. 7) Physical therapy using hydrotherapy, phototherapy, and biofeedback to promote recovery. 8) Traditional Chinese Medicine rehabilitation employing acupuncture, massage, electroacupuncture, iontophoresis of Chinese herbal medicines, including treatment for complications, extensively using internal and external Chinese medicines. 9) Nutritional therapy, developing a balanced diet plan to meet the needs of rehabilitation training."
"Amenorrhea, abdominal pain, genital bleeding, nausea and vomiting",Ectopic Pregnancy,"Treatment methods for ectopic pregnancy include: Surgical treatment, via laparotomy or laparoscopic surgery. (1) For severe internal bleeding and shock, active shock correction and blood volume replenishment should be carried out simultaneously with emergency surgery. Prompt laparotomy, extraction of the affected fallopian tube, clamping the mesosalpinx with an oval forceps to quickly control bleeding, accelerating infusion, and continuing the operation after blood pressure rises. (2) Surgical options: The routine procedure involves ipsilateral salpingectomy. For young women with fertility requirements, conservative surgery can be performed based on the implantation site of the fertilized egg, such as opening the fallopian tube to remove the embryo followed by local suturing or electrocoagulation hemostasis, or performing fimbrial squeezing to expel the embryo to preserve fallopian tube function. Careful observation intraoperatively and monitoring of vital signs and abdominal conditions postoperatively are essential, with a follow-up of blood β-HCG after 24 hours, the 3rd day, and the 7th day. If the decrease is unsatisfactory, methotrexate or traditional Chinese medicine treatments are supplemented to prevent persistent ectopic pregnancy. Blood β-HCG is reviewed weekly until normal. Sterilization can be considered by ligating the contralateral fallopian tube for those requiring it. (3) Autologous blood transfusion is one of the effective measures for rescuing ectopic pregnancy, especially in the absence of blood sources. The conditions for reinfusion of abdominal blood are: pregnancy less than 12 weeks, intact amniotic membrane, bleeding time <24 hours, uncontaminated blood, and red cell destruction rate <30%; for every 100ml of blood transfused, 10ml of 3.8% sodium citrate is added as an anticoagulant, filtered through a transfusion funnel padded with 6-8 layers of gauze or through a 20μm micropore filter before reinfusion; for 400ml of autotransfused blood, 10ml of 10% calcium gluconate is supplemented. Non-surgical treatment includes expectant management, chemical medication, traditional Chinese medicine, and interventional treatment, which should be carefully selected according to the condition. (1) Expectant management is suitable for patients without clinical symptoms or with minor symptoms; ectopic pregnancy mass diameter <3cm, no fetal heartbeat, no intraperitoneal bleeding or estimated internal bleeding less than 100ml; blood β-hCG <1000mIU/ml and continuously decreasing. Patients can be advised to rest at home, visit the hospital weekly for blood β-hCG reviews, and seek medical advice immediately if abdominal pain worsens. (2) Chemical medication treatment is for patients with fertility requirements, especially those with contralateral tubal removal or significant lesions. Indications include no significant abdominal pain, mass diameter between 3.5~5.0cm, β-hCG <2000~3000mIU/ml, stable vital signs, no active intraperitoneal bleeding signs, and normal liver function and blood count. Methotrexate 50mg/m² is commonly used, administered intramuscularly, with blood β-hCG reduction less than 15% after 4~7 days, allowing for repeat medication. Blood β-hCG returns to normal within an average of 35 days, with close monitoring of blood routine and ultrasound. Recently, mifepristone has been used for conservative treatment of ectopic pregnancy, still without consensus. (3) Traditional Chinese medicine treatment is one method for treating tubal pregnancy in China, avoiding surgical trauma and preserving the function of the affected side's fallopian tube. The primary prescription includes Salvia miltiorrhiza, Paeonia lactiflora, and Prunus persica, adjusted according to the syndrome. (4) Interventional therapy involves slow infusion of methotrexate 50~100mg into the uterine artery post-angiography, adding 5-Fu 500mg for larger gestational sac, followed by embolization with absorbable gelatin sponge particles. Close observation of vital signs after embolization and weekly review of blood β-hCG and ultrasound are necessary, due to high costs, currently limited to certain special types of ectopic pregnancy."
"Intense itching at the contact site followed by edematous erythema, wheals, papules, papulovesicles, or blisters the size of a green to yellow soybean, low-grade fever, acute conjunctivitis, keratitis, joint redness and swelling, and pruritus",Caterpillar Dermatitis,"Treatment strategies for caterpillar dermatitis include immediate washing of the contact area with an alkaline solution or the use of clear tape or adhesive bandages to repeatedly remove the toxic hairs from the lesion. It is important to avoid repeated scratching and washing with hot water. Topically, a 1% calamine lotion may be applied; for severe itching, oral antihistamines are recommended. Systemic symptoms that are more pronounced may be managed with oral corticosteroids; for arthropathy caused by pine caterpillars, anti-inflammatory and analgesic treatment should be administered."
"Low specific gravity urine, water intoxication, hyperkalemia, elevated urinary sodium, hematuria, proteinuria, and urinary casts",Renal Failure,"The treatment options for renal failure include: 
1. Etiological Treatment: This involves treating the primary cause of renal failure. For instance, replenishing lost fluids and electrolytes in cases of insufficient blood supply or blood loss; and targeted treatment for infections when present. 
2. Renal Function Support: As renal function is compromised, dialysis treatment (commonly referred to as 'kidney dialysis') is utilized temporarily to assist in removing toxins and waste products from the body. In patients with acute renal failure who do not receive appropriate treatment or fail to control the condition, the disease may progress to chronic renal failure, necessitating lifelong dialysis due to uremia. Dialysis refers to the selective removal of certain substances from the blood through filtration. This process eliminates toxic waste, water, and salts accumulated in the body post-renal failure, restoring the patient's health status. There are two main types of dialysis: Hemodialysis, which utilizes a special machine to replicate kidney function, and Peritoneal Dialysis, which uses the body's peritoneum as a filter to remove bodily toxins. 
3. Dietary Control: Due to impaired renal function, toxins and waste products generated from food cannot be properly excreted. Therefore, dietary modification is crucial to avoid additional strain on the body. 
4. Renal Transplantation: For some end-stage renal failure patients requiring long-term dialysis, kidney transplantation can offer a better quality of life under suitable patient conditions. However, kidney transplantation is a major procedure and, despite advancements in medical technology, requires thorough pre-operational assessment to increase the chances of success. Kidney transplantation involves surgically transplanting a donor organ into the recipient. Potential kidney sources include family members, spouses, close friends, or brain-dead individuals who consented to organ donation prior to death. The best match often comes from siblings due to the highest likelihood of genetic compatibility. Kidney transplantation represents the most effective treatment for renal failure, as the transplanted kidney can almost completely replace the function of the failed kidneys, allowing the patient to lead a normal life."
A solitary skin-colored nodule with a central punctum.,Pilomatricoma,"What are the treatment options for pilomatricoma? Pilomatricoma can resolve spontaneously, however, the time frame for resolution is unpredictable. More importantly, distinguishing this condition from a grade 1 squamous cell carcinoma, even after a biopsy, is challenging. Therefore, in lesions smaller than 2cm in diameter, biopsy excision or curettage combined with electrodesiccation is often necessary in the majority of cases. Intraleisural injection of 5-fluorouracil solution and direct injection of methotrexate (25mg/ml) ranging from 0.5 to 1ml, or intramuscular injection of methotrexate at 25mg/week, have proven to be effective. Additionally, injecting 1ml of bleomycin mixed with an equal volume of lidocaine directly into the lesion has been shown to lead to regression of the lesion within 20 days."
"Dry skin, pruritus, papules, keratinization, follicular keratotic plugs",Keratosis Pilaris,"What are the treatment options for Keratosis Pilaris?    1. Generally, no treatment is necessary. Topical application of 10% urea cream or 0.05% tretinoin cream can alleviate symptoms. Oral intake of Vitamin A or Vitamin E. In recent years, creams containing alpha-hydroxy acids have shown better therapeutic effects. 

   2. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) approach: For patients with spleen deficiency and dampness, the treatment should strengthen the spleen, remove dampness, and moisturize the skin, using modified Chushi Weiling Soup. For those with blood deficiency and wind dryness, the treatment should nourish the blood, dispel wind, and moisturize dryness, using modified Nourishing Blood and Skin Drink, as well as Siwu Tang, Wenjing Yiyiren Tang adjustments, or taking Dampness-Removing Pills, Moisturizing Pills, and Polygonum multiflorum tablets."
"Ascites, varicose veins, abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, edema of the lower extremities, hepatic venous outflow obstruction, pain in the liver region, jaundice, cyanosis, ulcers, shock",Budd-Chiari Syndrome,"The treatment methods for Budd-Chiari Syndrome include: 
1. Interventional surgical treatment: Interventional surgery is the preferred treatment for Budd-Chiari Syndrome due to its minor trauma and effective results. For patients with thrombosis in the inferior vena cava or hepatic veins, thrombolysis via catheterization can be performed first. Once the thrombosis is completely dissolved, balloon angioplasty can be conducted to expand the narrowed segment of the blood vessel. If the effect of balloon dilation is unsatisfactory, placement of stents in the hepatic veins or the inferior vena cava can be considered. 
2. Medical treatment: This includes a low-sodium diet, diuresis, nutritional support, and autologous abdominal fluid reinfusion. For patients with acute thrombosis formation within the first week, anticoagulants can be administered. However, most cases are diagnosed several weeks or months after thrombosis formation. Although conservative treatment can buy time for the formation of collateral circulation, most patients eventually require surgery. In Budd-Chiari Syndrome patients, especially those in the late stages, persistent ascites, and severe malnutrition are common. As pre-operative supportive therapy, medical treatment can improve patients' overall condition, reduce operative mortality, and facilitate postoperative recovery.
3. Surgical treatment: 
a) Diaphragmatic tearing through a right atrial approach: performed via an incision in the right fourth anterior intercostal space or through a sternotomy, followed by a longitudinal incision in the pericardium anterior to the right phrenic nerve. 
b) Inferior vena cava-right atrium shunt. 
c) Mesenteric vein-right atrium shunt. 
d) Radical surgery: Although radical surgery directly removes the primary lesion, recurrence is still possible in cases accompanied by inflammation of the inferior vena cava."
"Dark urine, anorexia, hepatomegaly, liver tenderness, jaundice, abnormal globulin, elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in serum, tense liver capsule, massive hepatic necrosis, increased serum alpha-fetoprotein, palmar erythema, fatigue",Hepatitis C,"Treatment options for Hepatitis C include:
1. Antiviral Treatment Regimen
Before initiating treatment, it is crucial to confirm whether the liver disease is caused by HCV infection. Only patients diagnosed with serum HCV RNA positivity require antiviral treatment. The most effective endorsed regimen is the combination of long-acting interferon, PEG-IFNα, and Ribavirin, which is the current standard of care (SOC) approved by EASL for chronic Hepatitis C. This is followed by the therapy combining conventional IFNα or compound IFN with Ribavirin, both superior to the use of IFNα alone. Pegylated interferon-α (PEG-IFNα) involves attaching an inert, non-toxic polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule to the IFNα molecule, which delays the absorption and clearance of IFNα after injection, allowing effective plasma concentration maintenance with once-weekly dosing.

Direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) incorporating protease inhibitors such as Boceprevir (BOC) or Telaprevir (TVR) in combination with interferon and Ribavirin as triple therapy, have been approved since May 2011 in the USA. Recommended for patients with genotype 1 HCV infection to enhance the cure rate. Boceprevir is taken three times daily post-meals (every 7-9 hours), or Telaprevir post-meal (not a low-fat diet) three times daily (every 7-9 hours). Monitoring of HCV RNA is crucial; if viral breakthrough occurs (serum HCV RNA rises >1log from the lowest value), protease inhibitors should be discontinued.

2. General Treatment for Patients with Hepatitis C
(a) Acute Hepatitis C: Evidence suggests interferon therapy can reduce the chronicity rate of acute Hepatitis C, performed 8-12 weeks after the acute hepatitis C virus infection onset, with a treatment duration of 12-24 weeks. The optimal treatment scheme is yet to be determined, yet early treatment is more effective for patients with genotype 1 and high viral load (>800000logIU/ml).
(b) Chronic Hepatitis C: The severity of liver disease should be evaluated before treatment, as those with recurrent abnormal liver functions or significant histological inflammation and necrosis (G≥2) or moderate to severe fibrosis (S≥2) are more likely to progress to cirrhosis and should receive antiviral therapy.
(c) Hepatitis C with Cirrhosis: For patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A), despite reduced tolerance and effectiveness of treatment, antiviral therapy under close monitoring is suggested to stabilize the condition, delay or prevent complications like liver failure and HCC. For patients with decompensated cirrhosis, interferon treatment is often poorly tolerated; liver transplantation may be considered if feasible.

3. Treatment for Special Cases of Hepatitis C
(a) Children and the Elderly: The experience on treatment of chronic Hepatitis C in children is still limited. Preliminary clinical study results show that IFNα alone has a higher SVR rate in children than in adults, with better drug tolerance. Antiviral treatment is also recommended for the elderly (>65 or >70 years old) based on comprehensive considerations including patient age, drug tolerance, co-existing conditions (such as hypertension, coronary heart disease), and patient willingness.
(b) Alcohol and Drug Users: Chronic alcohol misuse and drug abuse may promote HCV replication, exacerbating liver damage and accelerating the progression to cirrhosis or even HCC. Due to lower adherence, tolerance, and SVR rates, treatment of Hepatitis C must accompany cessation of alcohol and drug use.
(c) Co-infection with HBV or HIV: HBV co-infection can accelerate the progression of chronic Hepatitis C to cirrhosis or HCC. For patients positive for HCV RNA and negative for HBV DNA, anti-HCV treatment is prioritized; for those actively replicating both viruses, IFNα plus Ribavirin to clear HCV is recommended first, followed by anti-HBV treatment if HBV DNA remains positive after HCV treatment. Treatment strategies for patients co-infected with HIV also depend on the patient’s CD4+ cell count and liver fibrosis staging. Attention should be given to potential interactions between Ribavirin and antiretroviral nucleoside analogs, including lactic acidosis.

Antiviral treatment of Hepatitis C is long-term and may have significant side effects, requiring assessment, guidance, and safe medication under experienced professionals. Treatment efficacy should be promptly evaluated, guided by response, while closely monitoring for adverse drug reactions to minimize the occurrence of severe adverse events.

4. Contraindications for Antiviral Treatment
(a) Absolute contraindications for interferon include pregnancy; history of severe psychiatric disorders like major depression; uncontrolled epilepsy; untreated alcohol or drug addiction; uncontrolled autoimmune diseases; decompensated cirrhosis; symptomatic heart disease; pre-treatment neutrophil count <1.0×109/L; pre-treatment platelet count <50×109/L; acute phase organ transplant recipients (except for liver transplants).
(b) Relative contraindications for interferon include thyroid disease, retinopathy, psoriasis, history of depression, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension.
(c) Absolute contraindications for Ribavirin include pregnancy, severe heart disease, renal dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies, hemoglobin (HB) <80g/L.
(d) Relative contraindications for Ribavirin include uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled coronary heart disease, HB <100g/L."
"Commonly presents with masses, abscesses, sinus tracts, no spinal deformity, no significant restriction in activity, cough, hemoptysis, low fever, night sweats, chest pain, weight loss, loss of appetite, and menstrual disorder.",Spinal Tuberculosis,"Treatment options for spinal tuberculosis mainly involve surgery due to the smaller size of the lesion and its superficial location as compared to vertebral tuberculosis. Treatment is determined based on two scenarios: 1) For a minority of cases with milder and shorter disease duration without abscess, fistula, and neurological symptoms, non-surgical treatment is considered, primarily through antituberculosis medication to halt and cure the lesion. 2) For the majority of cases, aggressive lesion removal surgery is recommended under systemic antituberculosis medication treatment to prevent the progression of the disease into the spinal canal, which may cause neurological symptoms and paraplegia. During surgery, thorough removal of the osseous lesions, abscess, tuberculous granulation tissue, and caseous necrosis is necessary. Due to the small and irregular shape of lesions in various parts of the spinal arch, complete removal through scraping is often challenging, and surgery usually involves resection of the diseased bone base. Care should be taken to avoid entering the spinal canal during the removal of lesions on the lamina and pedicles to prevent damaging the dura mater and spinal cord nerves. If surgery requires entering the spinal canal for lesion removal and decompression, care should be taken to avoid dura mater damage. If the dura mater is damaged, it should be immediately sutured to prevent subdural infection and adhesion. Post-operatively, thorough irrigation and placement of drainage (strips, sheets, tubes) are essential to promote adequate drainage and prevent infection and fistula formation. Postoperative antituberculosis medication treatment should continue for 6 to 9 months."
"Abnormal spinal morphology, back pain, abnormal gait",Spina Bifida,"What are the treatment options for spina bifida? 
    Untreated myelomeningocele can lead to a mortality rate of 80-90% within the first year of life, primarily due to meningitis and ventriculitis. Therefore, surgical intervention is necessary, except for children with: 1) flaccid paralysis of the lower limbs, incontinence, and concurrent progressive hydrocephalus; 2) visible severe congenital malformations; 3) neonatal ventriculitis. 
    (1) The purpose of surgery includes removing the herniated sac, releasing adhesions between the spinal cord and nerve roots, repairing soft tissue defects, and preventing cyst rupture and tension on neural tissue. 
    (2) Timing of surgery: Myelomeningocele surgery should be performed within 12-24 hours after birth; simple meningocele ideally within 1-2 weeks after birth, or if possible, delayed to 2-3 months for a safer procedure. Emergency surgery is required if the cyst wall is thin with a risk of rupture and subsequent infection; in cases of cyst wall rupture and infection or CSF leakage, surgery should be pursued once infection is under control and the wound is clean or nearly healed. 
    (3) Surgical technique involves positioning the patient prone with elevated buttocks and lowered head to minimize loss of CSF. For lesions in the lumbosacral area, a transverse shuttle incision is preferred to avoid contamination with urine or feces. Key intraoperative considerations include: 
        a. Handling of neural tissue: Incise at the base of the herniated sac at the junction with normal skin, reaching the paraspinal fascia to locate the neck of the sac. Incise laterally to avoid damaging the neural tissue in the center of the sac. Carefully free, release the spinal cord and nerve, allowing them to retract back into the spinal canal. If retraction is difficult, the upper end vertebra may be removed to enlarge the spinal defect for satisfactory release. 
        b. Dural closure: Identify the dura mater at the upper end of the lesion, dissect laterally then downward to free it from the paraspinal fascia, and suture it securely. Subsequently, the paraspinal muscles and their fascia are sutured or tension-reduced to fortify the repair. 
        c. Correction of concurrent spinal deformities: Treat vertebral protrusion deformities, etc., with laminectomy and spinal fixation with metal wires. 
        d. Repair of skin defects: Excise translucent or thin-skinned areas, suturing in two layers without tension. Most skin defects can be closed if dissection is kept at the fascial plane; for defects larger than half of the back, specialized skin flap mobilization or free skin grafting is required. 
    (4) Postoperative care: The patient should be positioned prone with the head lower to reduce the hydrostatic pressure of CSF on the repair site. Wound dehiscence or CSF leakage often indicates concurrent progressive hydrocephalus, necessitating ventricular external drainage or ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery."
"Vomiting, recurrent hematemesis, hematemesis with melena, esophageal spasm",Mallory-Weiss Syndrome,"The treatment methods for Mallory-Weiss Syndrome include: 
1. Conservative treatment: Bed rest, closely monitor vital signs and hourly urine output, ensure airway patency to avoid asphyxiation during vomiting. Regularly recheck routine blood tests, and if necessary, monitor central venous pressure, especially in elderly patients. Fasting during bleeding episodes, and liquid diet can be resumed 24 hours after bleeding stops. If necessary, a gastric tube may be placed to remove gastric contents to avoid aggravation of tearing by a full stomach. 
(a) Actively replenish blood volume ensuring sufficient venous access, and if necessary, transfusion to maintain hematocrit (Hct) above 30%, and hemoglobin concentration above 70g/L. However, avoid excessive transfusions and fluid volume to prevent acute pulmonary edema or rebleeding. 
(b) Drug therapy for hemostasis, suppressing gastric acid secretion only effective when gastric pH >6.0, thus rapidly elevating intragastric pH is essential, commonly intravenous antacids, H2 receptor antagonists (e.g., cimetidine, famotidine), proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole, with the latter more frequently used clinically). Enhance mucosal protection with oral sucralfate, smectite (Diosmectite), compound glutamine (Mucosta); intravenous hemostatic drugs: aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid (AMCHA), thrombin, vasopressin; oral hemostatics: 0.8% epinephrine saline solution, thrombin. 
(c) Antiemetics for severe vomiting, such as metoclopramide (Reglan), domperidone, mosapride. Most patients with Mallory-Weiss Syndrome bleeding can be completely cured with drug treatment. 
2. Endoscopic treatment: With the development of endoscopic technology, endoscopic hemostasis plays a critical role in emergency gastrointestinal bleeding, indicated for patients with massive bleeding, active bleeding or recent bleeding detected by endoscopy. 
(a) Local spray hemostasis, which works by contracting blood vessels or forming a coagulum on the wound surface. Mainly for active exudative bleeding, especially suitable for superficial tears. 
(b) Injection hemostasis, achieved by injecting drugs into the tear edge or bleeding point, compressing and contracting blood vessels or local coagulation. 
(c) Titanium clip hemostasis, an effective method widely used recently. Under endoscopic view, metal hemostatic clips directly grasp the bleeding vessels or torn mucosa, achieving immediate hemostasis and prevention of rebleeding. Mainly for patients with active or signs of rebleeding. 
(d) Microwave coagulation therapy, generating high temperatures through rapid oscillation of polar ions within tissues, causing protein coagulation. Endoscopically place the microwave electrode close to the bleeding site, select power between 30-50W, and apply for 5-8 seconds until bleeding stops. 
(e) Other methods include argon plasma coagulation, similar in principle to microwave coagulation. The efficacy can reach 80%-90%, with perforation and bleeding as main complications. Postoperative oral antibiotics, hemostatics, and mucosal protectants are administered, with a 24-hour fasting period. 
3. Arterial embolization: For patients who fail conservative or endoscopic treatment, arterial embolization can be considered, mainly targeting the left gastric artery or its esophageal branches using Seldinger technique through femoral artery catheterization. After conventional angiography to assess the situation, use 1mmx1mmx1mm absorbable gelatin sponge particles for embolization. The sponge is absorbed within about 2 weeks. This method provides rapid and reliable hemostasis but requires experienced interventional physicians. 
4. Surgical treatment: For patients who fail conservative or endoscopic treatment, emergency surgery should be considered to ligate the bleeding vessels."
"Back pain, sacral pain, low-grade fever, tiredness, weight loss, night sweats, loss of appetite, anemia",Spinal Tuberculosis,"What are the treatment methods for spinal tuberculosis? 
(1) General diagnostic and treatment principles: 
Treatment includes the same general treatment as for bone and joint tuberculosis. Detailed surgical treatments are described below. 
(2) Posterior spinal fusion surgery: 
Indications include vertebral lesions that have stabilized but with unstable spine, failure or instability of anterior spinal graft, and absence of anterior grafting with unstable spine during lesion clearance surgery. Preoperative preparation involves standard orthopedic surgical protocols, spinal X-ray localization to determine the fusion site, and blood preparation. Attention points include precise localization, ensuring fusion encompasses 1-2 healthy vertebrae above and below the diseased vertebra, and if transverse process fusion is performed, an appropriate number of transverse processes must be included. Autologous iliac bone or allogeneic bone can be used as graft material. Generally, spinal kyphotic deformities do not require correction, but for severe kyphotic deformities, protruding spinous processes may be removed. Postoperative management involves lying on a hard board bed or wearing a plaster vest for 3-6 months, gradual mobilization once graft fusion is confirmed by X-ray, and early mobilization for patients with cervical or thoracolumbar plaster immobilization. Continue anti-tuberculosis treatment for 6-12 months (monitoring for drug toxicity), monthly erythrocyte sedimentation rate checks, extending to every 3 months. Follow-up visits and X-ray examinations every 3 months after surgery and semi-annually after one year. 
(3) Lesion clearance surgery: 
Cervical lesion clearance may be approached through the oral cavity for atlantoaxial tuberculosis. For C2-C7 tuberculosis, an anterior cervical approach is generally used, entering through an incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle between this muscle, the carotid sheath, thyroid, trachea, and esophagus, exposing the lesion site and after confirmation through biopsy, removing the lesion with a curette, thoroughly irrigating, and deciding on bone grafting based on the extent of bone loss. Care must be taken to avoid damaging the recurrent laryngeal nerve, superior laryngeal nerve, superior thyroid artery, esophagus, and trachea. Postoperative breathing should be monitored, and drainage tubes removed within 24-48 hours. For thoracic vertebrae, rib transversectomy lesion clearance is applicable to all thoracic vertebral tuberculosis, performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation through a midline incision adjacent to the thoracic spine, exposing and removing transverse processes and posterior segments of the ribs, ligating intercostal arteries, and reaching the vertebral body to clear the lesions. If the pleura is breached, it should be sutured immediately, and pleural puncture to evacuate gas performed at the end of surgery, with closed pleural drainage if necessary. For thoracic and lumbar spine, lesion clearance suitable for T11-L1 spinal tuberculosis generally involves general anesthesia, a 60° lateral position, using a combined thoracolumbar incision (similar to a renal incision), removal of ribs 11 and 12 if necessary, detaching the diaphragm, pushing the kidney forward, exposing paraspinal abscesses, ligating lumbar arteries, entering the lesion, and thoroughly clearing it. If vertebral destruction is severe, intervertebral bone grafting may be performed. For lumbar spine, appropriate for L3-L5 and S1 tuberculous lesions, performed under epidural or general anesthesia in a supine position through a midline incision, the abdominal wall is opened to the extraperitoneal space, pushing the peritoneum to expose the anterior spine and abscesses, if lesions are present on the opposite side, an incision may be made on that side as well."

Regardless of the method, the goal is to relieve resistance caused by the non-relaxation, incoordination, and spastic contraction of the lower esophageal sphincter, facilitating esophageal emptying. 2. Pharmacotherapy: There are limited drugs available for achalasia treatment, with nitrates and calcium channel blockers being somewhat effective in reducing lower esophageal sphincter pressure to facilitate emptying. However, their effect is short-lived and may not be effective for all patients. In such cases, dilation or esophageal myotomy may be considered. 3. Dilation: Esophageal dilation for the treatment of achalasia has been widely used and is constantly being improved with advances in science and technology for efficacy, safety, and comfort, making it adaptable for a wider range of application. Excluding patients with concurrent esophagitis since inflamed mucosal tissue is more prone to tearing and creating excess openings, dilation is generally recommended after medical control of inflammation for increased safety. Pre-procedure preparations include fasting and esophageal cleansing with a thick nasogastric tube to remove residual food, preventing aspiration and facilitating observation during the procedure. In addition to the traditional bougienage dilation, pneumatic or hydrostatic forced dilation are now utilized, providing long-term symptom relief. The procedure is performed under X-ray fluoroscopy guidance using an endoscope and guidewire to place the dilator, effectively preventing perforation risks. Pre-medication includes atropine, suitable sedatives, and analgesics. Under local anesthesia and fluoroscopy, the pneumatic or hydrostatic dilator is introduced into the esophagus, and pressure is applied when the dilating balloon spans the gastroesophageal junction, with the effect of dilation determining the necessity of further sessions. 4. Esophageal Myotomy: This surgical method aims to relieve the inability of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax, potentially improving esophageal emptying. The procedure is straightforward, easy to perform, with few post-operative complications, low mortality rate, and applicable to any age group. It has been used since the 1950s to treat achalasia."
"Local congestion and edema, unbearable pain, inflammation and pus formation, muscle atrophy, restricted movement",Osteomyelitis,"The treatment of osteomyelitis necessitates a three-pronged approach to ensure efficient and comprehensive recovery: timely and accurate diagnosis, effective integrated treatment, and prompt rehabilitative exercises coupled with routine healthcare maintenance. 

1. Timely and Accurate Diagnosis: The primary symptoms of osteomyelitis include joint swelling followed by pain, functional impairment, and muscle atrophy. Incorrect diagnosis or delayed treatment can lead to loss of the optimal treatment window, exacerbating the condition. 

2. Effective Integrated Treatment: Upon accurate diagnosis, immediate and appropriate treatment is crucial. Early-stage osteomyelitis may respond well to antibiotic therapy, yielding satisfactory results. 

3. Prompt Rehabilitative Exercises and Post-treatment Healthcare: It is advisable to pair treatment with functional exercises to prevent complications post-recovery and to maintain health through routine care."
"Sudden, transient, and temporary loss of consciousness",Syncope,"What are the treatment methods for syncope? Before treating syncope, what should be taken into consideration? 

Prevention: If there is a clear inducement, it should be avoided as much as possible. 

Emergency Treatment: Upon occurrence, do not panic. The patient should first lie down in a position with the head lower than the feet, loosen the collar and belt, ensure warmth and quiet. Acupoint stimulation can be applied to 'Ren Zhong' and 'Nei Guan', and warm tea or sugar water can be administered. Generally, after the above treatment, the patient quickly regains consciousness. In cases of syncope caused by severe bleeding or heart disease, immediate medical attention is necessary. 

Treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine: 
Qi Syncope: Characterized by sudden fainting due to emotional stimulation, unconsciousness, coarse breathing, clenched jaw and fists, limbs cold to touch, thin white tongue coating, deep forceful pulse or deep string-like pulse. Treatment principle: Smooth the Qi and relieve stagnation. Primary prescription: 'Wu Mo Yin Zi' with modifications such as adding 'Gou Teng', 'Shi Jue Ming', 'Ci Shi' for cases with excess liver yang, adding 'Suan Zao Ren', 'Yuan Zhi' for restless sleep, adding 'Dan Xing', 'Bei Mu', 'Zhu Li' for excessive phlegm. 
Blood Syncope: Characterized by sudden collapse, unconsciousness, clenched teeth, facial redness, dark red eyes, purple-black lips, red or dark purple tongue. Pulse string-like. Treatment principle: Activate blood and smooth the Qi. Primary prescription: 'Tong Yu Jian' with modifications like adding 'Gou Teng', 'Shi Jue Ming', 'Long Dan Cao', 'Dan Pi', 'Chang Pu' for irritability, and 'Ju Hua', 'Zhen Zhu Mu', 'Gou Qi Zi' for dizziness and headache. 
Heat Syncope: Symptoms include sudden collapse, shortness of breath, speechlessness, prostration, unstoppable cold sweat, flushed or pale face, thirst, scanty urination, red and dry tongue, rapid large pulse. Treatment: Clear heat, open orifices, augment Qi, and generate fluids. Primary prescription: 'Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang' with modifications for dampness-afflicted individuals, adding 'Bai Zhu', 'Cang Zhu Tang'. 
Phlegm Syncope: Characterized by sudden fainting, unconsciousness, gurgling phlegm in the throat or spitting saliva, coarse breathing, limbs cold to touch, white greasy tongue coating, wiry slippery pulse. Treatment principle: Move Qi and dispel phlegm. Primary prescription: 'Dao Tan Tang' with modifications like adding 'Su Zi', 'Bai Jie Zi' for phlegm obstruction, adding 'Huang Qin', 'Zhi Zi', 'Gua Lou Ren' for phlegm heat presenting with dry mouth and constipation, yellow greasy slippery pulse. 
Food Syncope: Sudden fainting due to overeating, chest tightness, epigastric and abdominal distension and pain, yellow greasy tongue coating, slippery pulse. Treatment principle: Harmonize the middle and promote digestion. Primary prescription: 'Shen Zhu San'. 

Western Medical Treatment: The focus is on treating the cause and preventing onset. During an episode, the patient should be made to lie down with the head lower, collars and belts loosened, leading to recovery of consciousness. If consciousness is slow to return, low blood pressure, slow heart rate, acupuncture at 'Ren Zhong' and other acupoints, intramuscular injection of sodium benzoate caffeine 0.25g or atropine 0.5mg can be tried. Oxygen inhalation may be necessary. If still ineffective, it's essential to rule out other severe organic causes of syncope. 

Etiological Treatment: If the cause has been identified, early treatment should be commenced. This is the most effective measure for curing syncope. Clear inducements should be avoided as much as possible."
"Febrile episodes with diaphoresis, lethargy, emaciation and weakness, nausea and vomiting, followed by fever headaches, projectile vomiting, neck stiffness, convulsions of the hands and feet, stupor and delirium, incontinence of urine and feces, may be accompanied by ptosis, strabismus, diplopia, blindness, aphasia, facial paralysis, hemiplegia, quadriplegia, and intellectual disability.",Cerebral Palsy,"What are the treatment methods for cerebral palsy?
Pre-treatment considerations for cerebral palsy
1. Syndrome of phlegm-fire obstructing orifices: Presents with fever, thirst without desire to drink, projectile vomiting, clouded consciousness, agitation, somnolence, even stupor, rales in the throat, red tongue, yellow greasy coating, and slippery rapid pulse. Treatment focuses on clearing heat, dissolving phlegm, and opening orifices.
2. Syndrome of blood stasis obstructing cerebral collaterals: Features headache with stabbing pain or persistent headache, dizziness and vertigo, or coma, projectile vomiting, cyanosis of the lips and face, dark tongue or with ecchymosis, and choppy pulse. The therapeutic principle is to dissolve stasis and unblock collaterals.
3. Syndrome of yin deficiency and ascendant liver wind: Manifests as body heat and emaciation, flush face, night sweats, convulsions or rigidity of limbs, projectile vomiting, yellow urine and dry stools, glossy red tongue without coating, and fine rapid pulse. The treatment should nourish yin and extinguish wind.
4. Syndrome of deficiency of both qi and yin: Symptoms include fatigue and lack of strength, shortness of breath and disinclination to speak, dry throat and mouth, flushed cheeks, or presence of night sweats, red tongue with little coating, and fine weak rapid pulse. The strategy involves augmenting qi and nourishing yin."
"Oral mucosa presents with white or grayish-white homogenous, harder patches of varying shapes and sizes, with a soft base, peak-like protrusions, raised lesions, uneven surfaces, and sometimes with papillary or spiky projections, palpably slightly hard.",Oral Leukoplakia,"The treatment options for Oral Leukoplakia include:
1. The primary measure involves eliminating irritants, such as stopping smoking, abstaining from alcohol, avoiding hot or spicy foods, and removing any dental causes like roots, crowns, or poor restorations. The use of caustic agents like phenol or silver nitrate on leukoplakia is strictly prohibited.
2. After rectifying harmful habits like smoking and if the lesion still persists, consider pharmacotherapy and further identify causative factors.
3. Oral Vitamin A administration at 50,000 IU daily, or retinoic acid at 35-50mg/d. Initial doses might cause headache or dizziness, hence dosage reduction may be considered, usually adjusting within a few days. From the second to third week, gradually increase the dosage to 30-60mg daily, divided into three doses, for a course of about 1-2 months. Common side effects include dry lips and hair loss. Contraindicated in patients with coronary heart disease, abnormal liver/kidney function, and hyperlipidemia.
4. A 0.2% retinoic acid solution is suitable for topical application but not for lesions with congestion or erosion. Application should be done after drying the saliva, using the finest brush to apply a small amount of solution along the white area, avoiding the vermillion border of the lips. Ointment formulations are not recommended due to poor adhesion to the slick oral mucosa. New formulations like isotretinoin and arotinoid essentially have similar effects to retinoic acid, with main advantages being lower dosages (0.5mg/kg daily), lower toxicity, and fewer side effects (dry lips, hair loss), but are teratogenic.
5. Long-term application of cod liver oil directly on leukoplakia 2-3 times a day, for a course of 1-2 months, without applying too much pressure, is recommended. Oral consumption of cod liver oil, or Vitamin A 50,000 IU is also an option. Close follow-up is essential during conservative treatment.
6. For lesions that do not heal over time, do not regress post-treatment, or if the white patches develop fissures, ulcerations, a hard base, significant thickening, or have proven to be precancerous, early surgical excision is recommended."
"Fatigue, headache, irritability, tremors, convulsions, difficulty breathing, cough",Hypernatremia,"The treatment modalities for hypernatremia vary depending on the underlying cause of elevated serum sodium levels. 
For hypervolemic hypernatremia, it is imperative to treat the primary condition, restrict the intake of sodium chloride solutions, and administer diuretics like furosemide and sodium bicarbonate to facilitate the excretion of sodium and water through the kidneys. In cases of pulmonary edema and heart failure, cardiotonic and diuretic therapies are recommended. 
For concentrated hypernatremia, it is essential to scientifically replenish water and take measures to prevent further loss of water to reduce hyperosmolality. If oral intake is possible, it should be prioritized. Intravenous administration of isotonic glucose solution can quickly decrease osmolality, but rapid correction of severe hypernatremia can lead to serious complications. Ideally, serum sodium levels should be brought close to normal within 48 hours. The formula for calculating dehydration volume is: 
Dehydration volume = Total body water x ([PNa/140] - 1) 
The total body water varies between genders and can be calculated based on 60% or 50% of dry weight per kilogram, but usually, calculating it as 50% for men and 40% for women is safer. For example, for a 60kg male patient with a serum sodium of 168mmol, the dehydration volume = 60 x 0.5 x (168/140 - 1) = 30 x (1.2 - 1) = 6L 
Type of fluids for rehydration varies according to the basic cause. For simple dehydration, 5% glucose water is used, and if necessary, small amounts of insulin should be injected. If there is also salt loss, 3/4 of the rehydration volume should be 5% glucose water, and the remaining 1/4 saline. If there is hypotension, saline should be administered first to improve tissue perfusion. If there is potassium deficiency, KCl can also be supplemented, but urinary output should be monitored; simultaneously, adding KCl can increase the total osmolality of the rehydration solution, which should be cautiously noted."
"Strabismus, easy excitability, girdle muscle weakness, muscular atrophy, painful contraction of the calf muscles, difficulty swallowing, prone to agitation",Congenital Myotonia,"What are the treatment options for Congenital Myotonia?
    1. Currently, there is no cure for this condition. Treatment is symptomatic, targeting myotonic symptoms. Many patients with mild symptoms have adapted to their condition, which does not significantly affect their daily lives; thus, they do not require special treatment. For severe cases, where myotonia adversely affects life and work, pharmacological treatment can be administered; progression usually does not significantly worsen in autosomal dominant cases. Autosomal recessive cases may slowly worsen and can be accompanied by transient muscle weakness;
    2. The principles of treating Congenital Myotonia and Myotonic Dystrophy are similar. There is good response to local anesthetics and antiarrhythmic drugs, which mainly act by inhibiting sodium channels, although their effects on chloride channels are not well understood. Mexiletine is the drug of choice.
    3. For neonates with congenital myotonia, care should be taken during feeding to avoid aspiration pneumonia. Those with accessory myotonia symptoms need to keep warm and avoid working in cold environments. During medication, patients should be aware of the potential side effects and undergo periodic blood counts and electrocardiograms. Acetazolamide, carbamazepine, and clonazepam also have demonstrated efficacy. Moderate doses of corticosteroids can reduce the severity of myotonia."
"High fever with chills, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, infectious febrile, bloody sputum resembling rotten peaches, diarrhea",Clonorchiasis,"What are the treatment methods for Clonorchiasis? Initially, symptomatic and supportive care is recommended for severe cases, including nutritional support, correction of anemia, and diuretics for edema reduction. Antiparasitic treatment should be initiated once the overall condition improves. Acute symptoms of Clonorchiasis, such as chills, high fever, pain in the liver area, and mild jaundice, along with elevated blood transaminases and a significant increase in eosinophils, may occur in some cases due to a large-scale infection at once. Clonorchiasis is prevalent worldwide, including in 24 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China, such as Guangdong, Shandong, and Henan.

1. Etiological treatment:

- Praziquantel is the first-line drug for treating Clonorchiasis. It is preferred due to its short treatment duration, high efficacy, low toxicity, mild reactions, and rapid absorption, metabolism, and excretion in the body. It is administered over two consecutive days. A three-month post-treatment follow-up shows a negative conversion rate of egg detection in feces of over 90%. Adverse reactions like dizziness, headache, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea may occur, usually subsiding within 24 hours. The standard therapeutic dosage does not significantly harm the liver or kidneys, though arrhythmias and premature contractions are noted in rare cases.

- Albendazole has been clinically used in recent years to treat this disease with satisfactory outcomes. It is administered in two doses over a 7-day treatment cycle, almost achieving a 100% negative conversion rate of egg detection in feces.

2. Symptomatic treatment:

For severely infected individuals with significant malnutrition or cirrhosis, nutritional supplementation and anemia correction are vital, along with liver protection to improve the overall condition, followed by timely antiparasitic treatment. In cases of cholecystitis or cholangitis co-infection, antiparasitic treatment is complemented by antibacterial drugs. Acute cases of cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, or common bile duct obstruction may require surgical interventions. In cases with concurrent viral hepatitis, besides active liver protection, antiparasitic treatment should be initiated as soon as the condition permits improvement."
"Low-grade fever, weight loss, debilitation, chest pain, muscle numbness, anorexia, paroxysmal nocturnal dry cough, cough with a small amount of glassy transparent viscid sputum, wheezing",Tropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia,"What are the treatments for Tropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia? 
 
Treatment 
 
Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) is the drug of choice, widely used to treat filariasis by directly killing adult worms and microfilariae. It is more effective against Wuchereria bancrofti infections than Brugia malayi infections, but adverse reactions are more severe with the former. The recommended dose is 6-12mg/kg per day, taken orally in three divided doses. DEC is rapidly absorbed orally and metabolized in the body, with almost complete excretion in the urine. A 3-week course is recommended. Side effects are mild, including occasional nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and insomnia. During the treatment period, the massive killing of filariae may cause chills, headache, generalized muscle pain, rash, and even laryngeal edema, which require special attention. Most patients can recover after a 3-week treatment, but acute relapses are possible, and continued use remains effective. If persistent respiratory symptoms, radiographic abnormalities, and hematological or serological abnormalities are present after DEC treatment, it suggests that chronic inflammation persists, evolving into chronic interstitial lung disease. Follow-up after standard treatment for 2-5 years showed that approximately 6 out of 139 patients had persistent symptoms, with a mild continuous increase in eosinophils in BALF. Chronic patients who respond poorly to treatment may benefit from alternative antifilarial drugs (e.g., Ivermectin) or corticosteroids. Arsenical agents such as melarsoprol can be used, with a dose of 400-600mg per day, given in 2-3 divided doses for a 10-day course; if necessary, discontinue for 10 days before starting a second course. In cases unresponsive to the above treatments, melarsoprol (sodium stibogluconate) 0.75mg intramuscularly, twice a week, for 4-8 administrations per course, starting with a smaller dose. If hematuria occurs, the drug should be immediately discontinued. Other antifilarial agents include Levamisole, taken orally at 150-200mg per day in two divided doses, although adverse effects are more significant than DEC. Furanoside has a significant killing effect on Brugia malayi and microfilariae, with a dose of 20mg/kg per day in 2-3 divided doses, for a 7-day course. Untreated patients usually experience symptoms for several weeks to months, which can resolve spontaneously but often relapse after a few months or years. The prognosis of this disease is good, with the majority being curable, although those who have developed fibrosis have poor treatment outcomes.

With treatment, the prognosis is good."
"Severe ear pain, especially when opening the mouth, chewing, pulling on the auricle, or pressing on the tympanic membrane.",Otitis Externa,"Treatment options for Otitis Externa include: 
- External treatment involves applying a hot compress with the decoction of previously used Chinese herbal medicine residues to the area in front of and behind the affected ear. 
- A paste made from Zijin Ding or Niuhuang Jiedu Pills mixed with boiled water can be applied to the swollen area of the external auditory canal; Fish stone fat ointment can also be used. 
- For individuals with swollen and painful preauricular or postauricular lymph nodes, externally apply a solution made from Zijin Ding or Niuhuang Jiedu Pills. 
- In cases where the otitis externa has developed into an abscess, incision and drainage can be performed, or a needle can be used to puncture the abscess to release pus and blood, followed by the application of Huanglian Ointment. 
- Additional treatments include acupuncture therapy, where acupuncture points such as Hegu, Neiguan, and Shaoshang are punctured to reduce swelling and alleviate pain."
"nodules, itching, edema, eyelid abscess, ptosis, conjunctival congestion, photophobia, tearing, nausea, and vomiting",Cysticercosis,"Treatment options for cysticercosis primarily involve surgical removal of the parasites from the eyes and subcutaneous tissues. Surgery is recommended once edema has reduced and a firm nodule has formed to extract the parasite. Following surgery, administration of Praziquantel is common, accompanied by corticosteroids to mitigate allergic reactions caused by the destruction of the parasite. Alternatively, injecting 2-4 mL of 40% alcohol mixed with Novocain into the cyst to kill the parasite, or using proteolytic enzyme solution (5-10 mL) for local injections every 5-10 days, typically results in healing after 2-3 sessions. Praziquantel dosage recommended is 25 mg per kg body weight, three times a day for two consecutive days, with a possible repeat course after one week if necessary, showing efficacy in treating ocular and subcutaneous cysticercosis. With timely diagnosis, the prognosis for cysticercosis is generally good, emphasizing the importance of early detection, diagnosis, and treatment. The parasite can also extensively invade organs such as the lungs, thoracic cavity, abdomen, or lymph nodes, leading to severe consequences."
"Breast lump, enlarged male breasts",Gynecomastia,"What are the treatment methods for gynecomastia?
1. Etiological Treatment: The causes of gynecomastia are complex, requiring an accurate diagnosis followed by cause-specific treatment. Primary gynecomastia in adolescence often has a tendency to self-resolve within about 6 months. In adults and elderly, primary gynecomastia may resolve on its own or may require pharmacotherapy. For secondary gynecomastia, treatment targets the underlying cause, and the enlarged breast often gradually recovers once the primary condition is cured.
2. Pharmacotherapy:
   (1) Selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen.
   (2) Androgen therapy may alleviate breast development in those deficient in male hormones, but it is not recommended in patients with normal levels of androgens as androgens can convert into estrogens in the body, potentially exacerbating breast development.
   (3) Aromatase inhibitors such as testolactone can inhibit the aromatization of androgens in the body, thereby reducing the production of estrogens.
3. Surgical Treatment: Besides etiological and pharmacological treatment, surgery can be performed on the enlarged breasts.
   (1) Indications for surgery include: a) male breast diameter greater than 4cm that does not resolve over time; b) significant aesthetic concerns due to breast enlargement; c) lack of significant response to conventional pharmacotherapy; d) patient's suspicion of malignancy, causing psychological distress.
   (2) Surgical techniques include: a) Subcutaneous mastectomy (preserving the nipple and areola) suitable for younger patients; b) Simple mastectomy (not preserving the nipple and areola) often suitable for older patients. Surgical specimens are sent for pathological biopsy to confirm diagnosis."
"Decreased frequency of bowel movements, reduced stool volume, hard stools, and difficulty in defecation",Constipation,"What are the treatment methods for constipation?
Western Medicine Treatments: The treatment should be based on the etiology and pathogenesis of constipation. For patients without intestinal stricture or obstruction and other organic lesions, the conservative treatment principle is to increase dietary fiber intake, develop a regular bowel movement habit, and avoid the use of strong laxatives. Dietary fiber can change the nature of stool, making it bulkier and stimulate colonic motility. Foods rich in dietary fiber include wheat bran, fruits, vegetables, gels, corn, fiber, soybeans, pectin, etc. The purpose of scheduling bowel movements is to prevent stool accumulation and impaction. Before training, it is necessary to cleanse the bowel, and patients are encouraged to have bowel movements after breakfast as much as possible. Pharmacological treatments can be divided into bulking agents, lubricant laxatives (such as paraffin oil), hyperosmotic laxatives (lactulose, sorbitol, etc.), and stimulant laxatives (castor oil, anthraquinone drugs).
Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatments: 
1. Syndrome differentiation treatment
(a) For excess constipation:
   - Heat constipation: Treat by clearing heat, purging the intestines, and moistening the bowels. Representative formula is Ma Zi Ren Wan with modifications according to specific conditions. For hard stool constipation, add Yuan Ming Fen for softening. For gallbladder and pancreas diseases, add Chai Hu, Huang Qin, and Jin Ling Zi; for appendicitis, add Dan Pi, Hong Teng, and Bai Jiang Cao.
(b) For qi stagnation constipation: Treat by smoothing the qi and moving stagnation. Representative formula is Da Chai Hu Tang with modifications.
(c) For deficiency constipation:
   - Qi deficiency constipation: Treat by nourishing qi and moistening the intestines. Representative formula is Huang Qi Tang, with modifications for severe cases.
   - Blood deficiency constipation: Treat by nourishing blood and moistening dryness. Representative formula is Si Wu Tang combined with Zeng Ye Tang, with modifications for specific symptoms.
   - Yang deficiency and cold stagnation constipation: Treat by warming and opening the bowels. Representative formula is Ji Chuan Jian, with additional ingredients as needed.
2. Single and experienced formulas
Examples include 10g of Senna leaf steeped in boiling water, taken twice daily; 10ml of honey orally or dissolved in boiling water, for regular use; 10g of Rhubarb steeped in boiling water, taken twice daily.
3. Other treatments
Enema therapy includes soap water enema (800ml) and glycerin enema (30ml) rectally. Traditional Chinese medicine treatments also include various specific pills and teas for clearing heat and moisturizing the intestines. Acupuncture and moxibustion therapy also play a role in treating constipation."
"High fever, vomiting, skin petechiae, bruises, lethargy, coma",Sepsis,"The treatment methods for sepsis include: 
Antibacterial treatment: It is crucial to initiate antibiotic therapy as early as possible. When the pathogen is unknown, drugs can be selected based on the route of bacterial invasion, the age of the patient, and clinical presentations. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are commonly used, or a combination targeting both gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, with adjustments made according to culture and sensitivity test results. 
1. For Staphylococcus aureus infections, drugs such as oxacillin, cephalosporins, and vancomycin are recommended, often administered intravenously in combination. After normalization of body temperature, treatment should continue for 10 days; 
2. For gram-negative rod infections, such as E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, a combination of third-generation cephalosporins with aminoglycosides can be used, and for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, ceftazidime with aminoglycosides or carbenicillin may be selected; 
3. For anaerobic bacterial infections, the combination of metronidazole with chloramphenicol is preferred. 
If there are purulent lesions, surgical incision and drainage, or aspiration should be performed in conjunction with systemic antibiotic therapy. 
Other treatments: Providing a high-protein, high-calorie, and high-vitamin diet to ensure nutrition. Intravenous administration of immunoglobulin, plasma, whole blood, or albumin in small, frequent doses may be given. In cases of severe septic symptoms, a short course (3-5 days) of corticosteroid therapy may be administered alongside adequate antibiotic treatment."
"Abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, nausea and vomiting, weight loss, cramping, malnutrition, diarrhea, emaciation, abdominal bloating",Ischemic Colitis,"What are the treatments for Ischemic Colitis? 
 1. Medical treatment 
 Treat the primary disease to eliminate causes. Patients with mild symptoms should initially receive conservative medical treatment. Principles include eating small meals frequently to expand blood vessels, reduce blood viscosity, and inhibit platelet adhesion and aggregation. Medications like isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide mononitrate, nifedipine, dipyridamole (Persantin), prostaglandin E (alprostadil) as well as papaverine, cotarnine, and enteric-coated aspirin are administered orally to improve intestinal blood circulation and alleviate clinical symptoms. The efficacy can be enhanced through catheter or peripheral intravenous drip of low molecular weight dextran, papaverine, and others. 
 2. Surgical treatment 
 If conservative medical treatment fails and angiography confirms severe stenosis in the celiac artery or mesenteric artery trunks, surgery can be considered after improving malnutrition, correcting cardiovascular functions, and hypoxemia. Common surgical methods include endarterectomy, autologous great saphenous vein or synthetic graft bypass, and vascular reimplantation. The choice of surgical technique depends on the patient's general condition and anatomical relationships of the lesion site. Surgery is not suitable for patients with extensive arteriosclerosis stenosis of small arterial branches or widespread small vessel vasculitis. 
 3. Interventional Radiology 
 In recent years, the development of interventional radiology has promoted the non-surgical treatment of chronic mesenteric ischemic diseases and opened new pathways. Percutaneous femoral artery puncture followed by balloon angioplasty at the stenosis of the celiac artery or superior mesenteric artery is one approach. Additionally, placing a titanium alloy stent at those key arterial narrowing sites can also achieve improved blood flow and alleviate ischemia; suitable for patients too frail for surgery, and sometimes can replace bypass grafting or endarterectomy."
"Pigment loss, pigmented rash, pigmentary abnormalities",Vitiligo,"What are the treatment methods for vitiligo? Treatment principles Since Western medicine has no cure for this disease, treatment methods and the choice of medication vary from person to person. This is mainly because the causes, triggering factors, clinical types, and condition of each patient are different, and so are the therapeutic effects. Early treatment principle: For initial vitiligo lesions, where melanocytes within the skin lesion are not completely destroyed, early treatment should be commenced in the hope of recovery. If the disease duration exceeds one year, the treatment course will be relatively extended; for those with disease duration of several years or longer, treatment is relatively difficult. Staged treatment principle: Vitiligo can be divided into stationary and progressive stages in terms of disease progression. Treatment should differentiate the disease stage and use medication flexibly. Internal treatment should be emphasized during the progressive stage, and strong sunlight exposure etc. should not be chosen. For the stable phase, topical medications should be considered primarily, in conjunction with phototherapy. Comprehensive treatment principle: The disease is relatively complex; any single treatment method is limited, and the treatment course is long with a very low cure rate. Therefore, treatment should adhere to a comprehensive approach. Integrative treatment of Chinese and Western medicine is undoubtedly better than the treatment with Western medicine alone. Western medicine treatments for vitiligo include: 1. Drug treatment: (1) Psoralen and its derivatives: For example, methoxsalen (8-methoxypsoralen) 20-40mg per day, taken 1-2h before exposure to long-wave ultraviolet light or external application of 1% methoxsalen (8-MOP) solution followed by irradiation with long-wave ultraviolet light (PUVA therapy) for several months, sometimes effective. However, the toxic side effects of this medicine should be noted. Or using psoralen injections intramuscularly, once a day, 2-4ml each time. (2) High doses of vitamins: Long-term intake of vitamins B, C, P. There are also reports of the internal use or injection of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), oral corticosteroid hormones. (3) There are reports on the treatment of this disease with copper-containing drugs, such as 0.5% copper sulfate solution orally, 10 drops/time for adults, three times/d (reduced for children). (4) Immune regulators such as oral levamisole, adults take 150mg/d, in three divided doses for 3 consecutive days every two weeks, for about 5-6 weeks, reduced for children. Or intramuscular BCG, oral bovine placenta, etc. (5) Local application of skin irritants to induce inflammation and promote pigment proliferation, commonly used ones include 30% psoralen tincture, nitrogen mustard alcohol (5ml hydrochloric acid nitrogen mustard plus 95% alcohol 10ml), phenol (pure carbolic acid), 25% to 50% trichloroacetic acid, Cantharidin tincture, etc. This method is only suitable for small lesions, and large blisters may appear after application. (6) Corticosteroid hormones such as 1% dexamethasone suspension for intralesional injection. 0.2% betamethasone added to 40% dimethyl sulfoxide for external application. Various corticosteroid creams and ointments such as betamethasone dipropionate ointment, halometasone cream, dexamethasone urea ointment etc. are used for topical occlusive treatment. 2. Surgical treatment: In recent years, full-thickness skin grafting for vitiligo lesions followed by PUVA therapy has been used, and autologous melanocyte transplantation has also been reported to be successful. 3. Depigmentation therapy: Also known as the reverse therapy, it is suitable for cases where the lesion area is large, exceeding half of the body surface area. 3%-20% monobenzyl ether of hydroquinone cream etc. can be used for external application. 4. Physical therapy: For small lesions, long-wave ultraviolet light irradiation or Bucky border X-ray can be used. 5. Acupuncture therapy: Plum blossom needle tapping can be used locally. Traditional Chinese medicine treatment for vitiligo includes: 1. Wind-heat accumulation type: [Main symptoms]: The skin lesion appears as pinkish-white plaques, with clear boundaries, mostly appearing on the face and exposed areas, which can be solitary or multiple. The disease generally develops rapidly, and the skin whitens before often itching. Accompanied by headache, limb fatigue, thirst but no desire to drink. The tongue is red, with white or greasy yellow coating, pulse is floating, slippery or slippery and rapid. [Pathogenesis]: Wind is a yang pathogen, adept at changing and has the characteristics of moving upwards and outwards. Therefore, the skin lesions develop rapidly and vary, mostly occurring on the head, face, and exposed areas. Wind pathogens tend to carry dampness and accumulate heat, hence the symptoms of headache, body fatigue, and thirst but no desire to drink. [Treatment principle]: Clear heat, alleviate dampness, activate blood, and disperse wind. [Prescription]: Herbs like bai ji li (Tribulus terrestris), fu ping (Duckweed), he shou wu (Polygonum multiflorum), chi shao and bai shao (red and white peony roots), qin jiao (Gentiana macrophylla), fang feng (Saposhnikovia divaricata), dong gua pi (winter melon skin), fu ling (Poria cocos), cang zhu (Atractylodes lancea), cang er zi (Xanthium sibiricum), long dan cao (Gentiana scabra), bai wei (Cynanchum atratum), etc. 2. Liver qi stagnation type: [Main symptoms]: The skin lesion appears as white plaques with variable shades and no fixed predilection sites. The plaques can be round or oblong, or irregular cloud-like shapes, without itching or pain. The onset can be rapid or slow, but often worsens or alleviates with emotional changes, more common in women. Accompanied by symptoms such as irritability, chest and flank distension, and irregular menstruation. The tongue is slightly red, with a thin yellow coating, and the pulse is wiry. [Pathogenesis]: The liver governs the spreading and regulation of qi. If emotional injury occurs, causing abnormal liver qi regulation and qi mechanism disorder, resulting in disharmony between qi and blood, and prolonged duration leads to skin nourishment loss and white plaques formation. Liver qi counterflow then leads to irritability, chest and flank distension. [Treatment principle]: Soothe the liver, relieve depression, activate blood, and expel wind.

The disease course is long, and the progression is slow, with poor treatment outcome and often a family history. Accompanied by symptoms such as soreness and weakness in the lumbar and knees, dizziness and tinnitus, dry eyes, with a pale tongue, thin coating, and fine, weak pulse. [Pathogenesis]: The kidney stores essence and generates marrow, connected to the brain, opening into the ears; the liver stores blood, governs the tendons, and opens into the eyes. The liver and kidney share the same source, with mutual generation between essence and blood. If congenital endowment is weak and kidney essence is deficient, leading to liver blood deficiency, marrow sea depletion, loss of nourishment to the ears and eyes, and loss of nourishment to the skin, resulting in white plaques and symptoms such as tinnitus and dry eyes. [Treatment principle]: Nourish the liver and kidney, enrich blood, and dispel wind. [Prescription]: Herbs like shou wu teng (Polygonum multiflorum vine), bu gu zhi (Psoralea corylifolia), hei zhi ma (Sesamum indicum), nu zhen zi (Ligustrum lucidum), han lian cao (Eclipta prostrata), fu pen zi (Rubus chingii), sheng di (Rehmannia glutinosa), shu di (processed Rehmannia glutinosa), gou qi zi (Lycium barbarum), xian ling pi (Epimedium), xian mao (Curculigo orchioides), bai ji li (Tribulus terrestris), etc. 4. Qi stagnation and blood stasis type: [Main symptoms]: The skin lesion is mostly asymmetric white plaques, with clear boundaries, often occurring after trauma or other skin injuries. The plaques are darker in color, with slight pain. The plaques' hair turns white, and the disease progresses slowly, with slow treatment effect. Accompanied by symptoms such as dull facial complexion and rough skin. The tongue is dark purple with stasis spots, the sublingual veins are tortuous, the coating is thin, and the pulse is fine and rough. [Pathogenesis]: Qi and blood stagnation, blocked meridians, closed hair pores, unable to nourish the body skin, resulting in white plaques, as stated in "

"Lymph node enlargement, inflammatory cell infiltration, leukocytosis, tenderness and swelling of the submandibular lymph nodes, tenderness, edema, abscess",Submandibular Space Infection,"What are the treatment methods for submandibular space infection? The formation of an abscess in the submandibular space can encompass a broad area with a large abscess cavity. However, if caused by lymphadenitis leading to cellulitis, the abscess may be confined to one or several lymph nodes. In such cases, incision and drainage must separate the lymph node capsule forming the abscess to achieve the anticipated outcome. The position and length of the incision for submandibular space incision and drainage should be determined based on the location of the abscess and the areas where the skin has thinned. Generally, an incision parallel to the lower edge of the mandible is made 2 cm below it; after incising the skin and the platysma, blunt dissection with a hemostat is used to enter the abscess cavity. If the abscess is within a lymph node, it is necessary to separate the lymph node capsule, while also being mindful of the possibility of multiple lymph node abscesses. Careful examination during the surgery is essential to provide adequate drainage for each."
"Angina, swelling pain, vague numbness and discomfort in the back, chest pain",Thoracic Outlet Syndrome,"What are the treatments for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome?
  (I) Treatment
    1. Conservative Treatment: Local block at painful points in the neck, physical therapy for the neck.
    2. Surgical Treatment: Decompression of C5 and C6 nerve roots, release of the combined trunk of the accessory nerve and the long thoracic nerve; in cases accompanied by TOS, sectioning of the anterior and middle scalene muscles and the minor rhomboid muscle.
  (II) Prognosis
    Among the 16 patients with Thoracic Outlet Syndrome treated by the author, 10 cases were accompanied by accessory nerve compression, 4 cases accompanied by TOS, and 2 cases were solely long thoracic nerve compression. Out of the patients with concomitant accessory nerve compression, 6 received conservative treatment, where 4 showed disappearance of symptoms after 3-4 local neck block treatments, and 2 showed poor effects subsequently treated surgically. A total of 10 patients underwent surgical treatment, among which the 4 patients accompanied by TOS reported disappearance of discomfort and pain in the chest, but 3 continued to feel discomfort in their back, 1 felt worse than before surgery. Continuous intermittent local block treatments in the neck are still being administered. 
    Among the 2 patients with sole long thoracic nerve compression, 1 disappeared symptoms after receiving 3-4 sessions of local block treatment in the neck as conservative treatment; another underwent surgical treatment, decompressing the C5 nerve root along with the release of the accessory and long thoracic nerve trunk, after which symptoms completely disappeared without recurrence after 2 years of follow-up."
"Insidious onset, slow progression, limb weakness, muscle atrophy, difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, difficulty breathing",Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS),"There are no effective cures for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), treatment mainly focuses on symptomatic relief. 1. For those with difficulty breathing, oxygen therapy is provided, along with assisted ventilation when necessary. 2.

"Tooth eruption pain, weak mastication, tooth structure damage, root exposure, sensitivity to hot and cold, tooth discoloration",Dental Caries,"There are several methods to treat dental caries, aiming to halt the progression of the disease and restore the tooth's natural shape and function. 

1. Medication Treatment: This involves the application of medicinal substances to inhibit the progression of caries on the basis of removing the decayed area. It is suitable for shallow caries in permanent teeth not yet forming cavities and in anterior primary teeth. Common medications include Silver Nitrate and Sodium Fluoride. 

2. Dental Amalgam Filling: For teeth with substantial defects, amalgam filling is the most widely used and effective method. The procedure involves removing decayed tissue and weak tooth structure, then shaping the cavity into an appropriate form followed by filling it with the amalgam material. It is applicable for posterior teeth and concealed cavities in anterior teeth. 

3. Composite Resin Filling: Suitable for the filling of anterior teeth and posterior teeth not subject to chewing forces. 

4. Acid Etch Photopolymerized Composite Resin Filling: Similar indications as for composite resin filling but also suitable for teeth with extensive structure loss, poor retention, and covering discolored teeth. 

5. Inlays: Made of metal or other materials, inlays fit into the cavity and are embedded within. Onlays cover the occlusal surface. Indications include: large occlusal surface cavities in posterior teeth or those at risk of fracturing; when neighboring surface fillings cannot restore the proximal relation with adjacent teeth; or as a semi-fixed bridge abutment tooth."
"Abdominal distention, pale complexion, weakness, bleeding",Splenomegaly,"The treatment for splenomegaly should initially focus on addressing the primary disease causing the enlargement. Splenectomy and radiation therapy do not cure the root cause of splenomegaly; hence, the primary disease must be actively treated if the initial treatment does not yield results. Post-splenectomy, the treatment for the primary disease should continue aggressively. Indications for splenectomy include: 
1. Significant enlargement of the spleen causing marked compression symptoms. 
2. Severe anemia, especially in cases of hemolytic anemia. 
3. Substantial thrombocytopenia and bleeding symptoms. Post-splenectomy, there is a risk of developing thrombocytosis and even thrombosis if the patient had normal or slightly reduced platelet counts; thus, splenectomy is not recommended for these individuals. 
4. Neutropenia with a history of recurrent infections. 
Patients should undergo thorough preoperative preparation. This may include blood transfusions for individuals with severe anemia, treatment with corticosteroids for those with thrombocytopenia and bleeding, and proactive infection prevention in patients with neutropenia."
"Limb numbness, sensory loss, paralysis",Meralgia Paresthetica,"Treatment for Meralgia Paresthetica involves identifying and addressing the underlying cause. Options include: 
1. Physical therapy, including massage, electrotherapy, thermotherapy, magnetotherapy, and iontophoresis following ultraviolet irradiation. 
2. Administration of VitB1, VitB12, and gabapentin may be effective. 
3. Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve injection technique: At a point about 10cm below the anterior superior iliac spine in the sartorius muscle, a 12-gauge needle is inserted perpendicularly 3-4cm deep, slowly injecting a mixture of 100 mg VitB1 or with 100 mg VitB12, once a day, for a course of 5-10 treatments. Injections can also be combined with acupoints such as Fengchi, Xuehai, and Fuxi. 
4. In cases of refractory and severe pain, neurotomy or decompression surgery may be considered."
"Seizure-like episodes, headache, dizziness, vomiting, nausea, increased intracranial pressure, hallucinations, tinnitus, convulsions, forced head position, decreased hearing, ataxia",Cysticercosis,"Treatment options for cysticercosis include the following: For ocular cysticercosis, surgical removal of the parasite is necessary. In patients with obstructive hydrocephalus due to cerebral cysticercosis, surgical removal of the cysticerci obstructing pathways is recommended before initiating pharmacological treatment to prevent complications. 

Etiological treatment includes: 

1. Albendazole: Albendazole is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic. Discovered in 1987 to be effective against neurocysticercosis, it has become the drug of choice for treating cysticercosis due to its proven efficacy, with a significant improvement rate of over 85% and mild side effects. 

2. Praziquantel: Praziquantel is another broad-spectrum anthelmintic, typically administered at a dose of 40mg/(kg/d) in three divided doses over 9 days, with about 60%–70% of cerebral lesions resolving. If necessary, another course of treatment may be repeated after one month. 

Symptomatic treatment involves managing the host's immune response, which is the main cause of complications in neurocysticercosis. Some patients, due to immunological tolerance, might harbor cysticerci in the brain for a long time with mild or no symptoms, while others might experience severe immune reactions leading to edema, fibrosis, and vasculitis around the lesion. The prognosis and extent of neurological damage are directly related to the host's immune response rather than the direct damage caused by the cysticerci themselves. 

1. Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone (administered at a high dose of 30mg daily) or methylprednisolone [20–40mg/(kg·d)], are effective anti-inflammatory agents ideal for treating cysticercal encephalitis and inflammatory responses due to parasite necrosis, primarily aiming at controlling cerebral edema. 

2. For patients with increased intracranial pressure, initially administrate 20% Mannitol 250ml daily intravenously along with 5–10mg of dexamethasone for 3 days before starting etiological treatment. Dexamethasone and Mannitol can also be routinely used during treatment to prevent or mitigate adverse effects. 

3. Antiepileptic treatment is given to patients experiencing seizures."
"Fatigue, jaundice, splenomegaly, ascites, hematemesis, melena, edema, hypertension, oliguria, hematuria",Hepatorenal Syndrome,"The treatment strategies for Hepatorenal Syndrome include: 
1. General care for patients with hepatorenal damage focuses on rest, primarily bed rest in the later stages, providing a nutrition-rich diet, and administration of hepatoprotective medications along with treatments aimed at managing ascites. Portal hypertension may be managed surgically via splenorenal shunt operations, and splenectomy may be considered in cases of splenomegaly with hyperactive spleen function. 
2. Treatment for hepatorenal syndrome with glomerular damage is primarily directed towards the underlying liver condition, as this syndrome often evolves from viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, or being HBsAg positive. It's crucial to protect the liver from further damage by avoiding harmful stimuli. Treatment for nephritis follows the guidelines for primary glomerulonephritis, however, the use of steroids and cytotoxic drugs is contraindicated in liver impairment. In cases of hepatic-induced incomplete renal tubular acidosis, treatment may be unnecessary if there’s no hypokalemia or metabolic acidosis, but attention should be paid during diuretic therapy or intravenous glucose administration due to the risk of hypokalemia. Corticosteroid therapy may improve some patients' conditions. 
(a) Etiological hepatoprotection involves adequate protein and carbohydrate intake to ensure energy supply, along with multivitamin administration, especially B-complex vitamins, and the supplementation of trace elements. 
(b) Prednisolone is the preferred corticosteroid, potentially used alongside low-dose immunosuppressants such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide. 
(c) To correct acidosis and replenish potassium, oral sodium citrate combination can be used, and if severe hypokalemia is present, potassium citrate may be added to the sodium citrate combination or orally administered as a 10% potassium citrate solution. 
(d) Calcium supplementation for bone disease typically involves the use of calcium carbonate, lactate calcium, or gluconate calcium, avoiding calcium chloride to prevent exacerbating acidosis. Vitamin D supplements can be administered orally or intramuscularly; severe cases might benefit from oral calcitriol (Rocaltrol). Monitoring serum calcium levels is necessary during treatment to adjust doses or reduce maintenance amounts."
"Pustules on the skin, crusting, oozing of yellow fluid, extensive maceration, itching",Impetigo,"What are the treatment methods for Impetigo? 1. Internal Treatment: (i) In cases of summer-heat and damp-heat accumulating, presenting as dense pustules that are yellow in color, surrounded by a halo of redness, and fresh red erosive surfaces; accompanied by dry mouth, dry stool, dark yellow urine; with a red tongue, greasy yellow coating, and slippery rapid pulse. Treatment Principle: Clear summer-heat, promote diuresis, and detoxify. Prescription: Modified Qing Shu Tang (Clear Summer-Heat Decoction). For those with severe heat and restlessness, add Huang Lian (Coptis) and Shan Zhi (Gardenia) to clear heat and relieve irritability; for those with constipation, add raw Da Huang (Rheum palmatum) to facilitate bowel movements. (ii) In cases of spleen deficiency with damp accumulation, presenting as sparse pustules that are pale white or light yellow, with pale red erosive surfaces; accompanied by poor appetite, loose stool; with a pale tongue, thin slightly greasy coating, and soft fine pulse. Treatment Principle: Strengthen the spleen and leach out dampness. Prescription: Modified Shen Ling Bai Zhu San (Ginseng, Poria, and Atractylodes Powder). For those with food stagnation, add Bing Lang (Areca) and Jiao San Xian (burnt mixture of three herbs) to promote the movement of qi and alleviate stagnation."
"Cough, expectoration, wheezing",Aspergillosis,"What are the treatment methods for aspergillosis? General treatment includes actively treating the primary disease and removing its cause; strictly controlling the indications for the use of antibiotics, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants, using them as little as possible or not at all; and enhancing nursing and supportive therapy, supplementing vitamins and trace elements. Antifungal therapy involves Nystatin (local application in the form of oil, cream, powder, or solution at a concentration of 100,000U/g or /ml of base, applied topically 2-4 times a day depending on the patient's specific conditions; oral administration for intestinal candidiasis, with the dosage for newborns at 200,000-400,000U/day, for children under 2 years old at 400,000-800,000U/day, for those older than 2 years at 1-2 million U/day, divided into 3-4 doses before meals, with a treatment course of 7-10 days; nebulizer inhalation for respiratory candidiasis, with 50,000U of Nystatin dissolved in 2ml of 0.9% sodium chloride solution for inhalation. Amphotericin B, a polyene antibiotic, binds to the sterols in the fungal cell membrane, altering its permeability and destroying the fungal cells, is the drug of choice for cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and systemic candidiasis, though less effective for aspergillosis. Administration methods include intravenous drip starting with a small amount, gradually increasing from 0.1mg/kg/day to 1-1.5mg/kg/day over a course of 1-3 months; intrathecal or intraventricular injection is reserved for severe cases of cryptococcal meningitis or when IV therapy fails. Side effects of Amphotericin B include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, chills, headache, dizziness, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and thrombophlebitis, with certain toxicity to the liver, kidneys, and hematopoietic system. To minimize side effects, administer aspirin half an hour before and three hours after therapy; in severe cases, intravenous hydrocortisone or dexamethasone may be used. During treatment, blood and urine routine tests and liver and kidney functions should be monitored every three to seven days, and dosages should be adjusted based on serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. 5-Fluorocytosine is an oral systemic antifungal chemotherapeutic agent with inhibitory effects on Cryptococcus and Candida albicans. It can be used in combination with Amphotericin B for systemic cryptococcosis, with dosages of 50-150mg/kg/day divided into four oral doses over a 4-6 week treatment course. Clotrimazole, a broad-spectrum antifungal, is available as a 1-5% topical cream and has oral formulations. Ketoconazole, an oral azole antifungal derived from imidazole, inhibits ergosterol synthesis, altering fungal cell permeability and resulting in fungal death, effective against candidiasis, aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, etc., with initial dosages based on patient weight and age. Fluconazole, a triazole antifungal similar to ketoconazole in mechanism and antimicrobial spectrum, has greater in vivo antifungal activity and bioavailability, with suppressive effects against Candida and Cryptococcus, achieving effective therapeutic concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment principles include diagnostic confirmation through smear examination and culture of samples from the infection site; medication choice based on the infection site and pathogen type; prolonged treatment duration, generally 6-12 weeks or longer; combination of synergistic antifungal drugs for severe infections, preferably administered intravenously to enhance effectiveness and delay resistance; concurrent treatment of underlying diseases to boost immune function; and surgical intervention when indicated."

1. Treatment of the underlying disease: Intensifying the treatment of the underlying condition is the primary measure to reduce the factors promoting DIC and to increase patient survival. 
2. Use of blood products: The application of blood products is essentially a replacement therapy. This includes concentrated platelet suspensions, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, fresh whole blood, prothrombin complex concentrates, etc. 
3. Heparin use: Heparin treatment can be beneficial for some patients with chronic DIC. Its application in acute DIC patients requires careful consideration. 
4. Antifibrinolytic agents: These agents should be used with caution."

Lipid-lowering drugs such as Vitamin B6 (to inhibit arteriosclerotic plaques formation, 50-200mg/day, intravenous injection over 20 days), high doses of Vitamin C (0.5-1g/day) or Vitamin B12 (500-1000μg/day) through muscular injection, which are beneficial for lipid metabolism. 2. Vasodilators like Diprophylline, Nicardipine, Nimodipine, and extended-release nitroglycerin to enhance cerebral circulation. 3. Hormonal treatment with small dosages of cortisone for elderly to improve reduced memory due to arteriosclerosis and for premenopausal women, low-dose estrogen may be used. Additionally, for cerebral arteriosclerosis concurrent with cerebral ischemia or stroke, corticosteroids like dexamethasone are administered. 4. Symptomatic treatment for headaches, insomnia, and irritability can include sedatives such as diazepam, lorazepam, and small doses of aspirin. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) approaches include reinforcing kidney essence and brain marrow, regulating Yin and Yang, transforming phlegm and clearing turbidity, and promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis to reach the cerebral vessels. Herbs and formulas are prescribed based on individual's conditions and symptoms, with the combination of acupuncture and moxibustion techniques to enhance the therapeutic effects. For moderate high blood lipids, hypertension, and minor strokes, western medications are used for symptomatic treatment. Non-pharmaceutical therapies serve as complementary methods, enhancing and consolidating the treatment efficacy for cerebral arteriosclerosis."
"Amenorrhea, abdominal pain, and minor vaginal bleeding. After rupture, it presents as acute, severe abdominal pain that recurs, with vaginal bleeding leading to shock.",Ectopic Pregnancy,"Treatment options for ectopic pregnancy include salpingectomy, which is suitable for emergency patients experiencing internal bleeding and shock, and who do not have fertility requirements. For young women desiring future pregnancies, a salpingostomy may be considered."
"Pigment loss, hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation, frontal vitiligo",Vitiligo,"There are several treatment modalities for vitiligo, including: 

1. Physical therapy: Vapor bath therapy can alleviate symptoms by allowing direct application of medication to the skin, which is then absorbed transdermally into the bloodstream. This method offers fast and comfortable relief without adverse side effects and does not increase the burden on the liver, making it an excellent adjunctive treatment. Moreover, combining treatment with dietary and lifestyle management can enhance therapeutic outcomes and effectively prevent relapse. 

2. Pharmacotherapy: Patients should undergo timely examinations at hospitals to identify the cause of the condition and receive targeted pharmacological treatment for optimal results. 

3. Surgical therapy: Surgical removal of affected skin is an option for patients with small areas of vitiligo. However, this method is primarily suitable for those with less extensive or smaller areas of skin damage. In cases of more extensive skin damage, skin grafting or melanocyte transplantation may be required."
"Night blindness, progressive vision loss, narrowing of the visual fields",Retinitis Pigmentosa,"What are the treatment options for Retinitis Pigmentosa?
    There is a lack of effective treatments to slow down the progression of retinal degeneration. In recent years, fetal retinal neural layer transplantation into patients has been explored, with preliminary reports confirming potential improvements in vision. Literature mentions the trial use of vasodilators, vitamin A and B1, tissue therapy, various hormones, traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, and other methods, which may prevent rapid deterioration of visual functions.
    1. The use of sunglasses is essential as bright light can accelerate the degeneration of the photoreceptor outer segments. Theoretically, the lens color should match the color of the visual purple (rhodopsin), being purplish-red. However, for cosmetic reasons, gray lenses are used; number 0 to 1 in cloudy weather or indoors, and number 2 to 3 gray lenses in sunny or bright light conditions. Dark black sunglasses are not suitable, and green lenses are prohibited.
    2. Avoiding excessive mental and physical stress. During excessive stress, the level of catecholamines in body fluids increases, which causes the choroidal vessels to constrict, leading to hypoxia and thus exacerbating photoreceptor degeneration. Traditional Chinese Qi Gong (static exercises), which involves using one's will to regulate the activities of the cerebral cortex and various organs of the body, if practiced persistently, might be beneficial in preventing rapid deterioration of visual functions in this disease."

"Neuralgia, numbness in hands and feet, lower back pain, sciatica",Neurofibromatosis,"The treatment options for neurofibromatosis include the following: 
Surgical removal of the tumor is possible depending on the size of the tumor, with complete excision usually preventing recurrence. Incompletely excised cases might occasionally undergo sarcomatous transformation. Malignant neurofibromas have a poor prognosis, often leading to death within a short period. 
For surgical excision, it is advisable to undertake inactivation of the tumor bed by methods such as wiping with anhydrous ethanol, cauterization with an argon beam coagulator, or cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen. 
Generally, there is no malignant transformation. However, incomplete excision might occasionally lead to sarcomatous transformation. Malignant neurofibromas have a poor prognosis."
"Fever, localized redness, warmth, pain, and purulent discharge, local inflammatory conditions or pigmentation, chronic sinus tracts, and history of adhesion scars to the bone.",Osteomyelitis,"The treatment options for Osteomyelitis include: 
(1) Acute Phase 
    a. Surgical Incision and Drainage: Immediate opening of the wound for drainage to prevent pus from entering the bone marrow cavity. 
    b. Adequate Broad-spectrum Antibiotics: Systemic use of antibiotics, adjusted based on the results of bacterial culture and drug sensitivity tests. 
    c. Debridement: Sequential debridement to remove foreign material, necrotic tissue, and loose bone fragments from the wound. 
    d. Limb immobilization and dressing change: Immobilization with a cast, with holes for changing dressings; or use of an external fixation brace for easier dressing changes. After treatment, the condition progresses to the chronic phase. 
(2) Chronic Phase 
    a. Bone Exposure: Exposure of the bone and subsequent sequestration, which prevents neighboring granulation tissue from growing in. 
    b. Sinus Tract Formation: Development of infectious sinus tracts and leakage. 
    c. Others: Skin defects, infectious nonunion or bone defects may occur."
"Claw hand, deformities, short stature, short neck, scoliosis, and underdeveloped hip joints",Mucopolysaccharidosis Type III,"There are no specific treatments for Mucopolysaccharidosis Type III. For patients with severe deformities, surgical orthopedic correction is recommended. Symptomatic treatment should be provided for infections and heart failure, including: 
 1. Rest: Limit physical activities and avoid emotional stimuli to reduce the cardiac workload and facilitate the recovery of cardiac function. However, prolonged bedrest may lead to the formation of venous thrombosis, increasing the risk of pulmonary embolism and decreasing digestive function. Therefore, patients with heart failure are encouraged to exercise actively. Depending on the condition, start with sitting up in bed and gradually increase to symptom-limited aerobic exercises, such as walking. 
 2. Sodium intake control: Patients with heart failure often have an increased blood volume and sodium retention, thus reducing sodium intake can help alleviate symptoms of edema."
"Enlarged spleen, anemia, infections, petechiae, ecchymosis",Splenomegaly,"Treatment options for splenomegaly primarily focus on addressing the underlying disease causing the condition. If direct interventions prove ineffective, splenectomy may be considered, followed by rigorous management of the primary illness. Indications for spleen removal include: significant splenomegaly causing notable compression symptoms, severe anemia especially in cases of hemolytic anemia, substantial thrombocytopenia with bleeding symptoms (not recommended if platelet count is normal or slightly reduced due to risks of thrombocytosis and potential thrombosis post-splenectomy), and neutropenia with a history of recurrent infections. Prior to surgery, patients should receive thorough preparatory care such as blood transfusions for severe anemia, corticosteroids for thrombocytopenia with bleeding, and proactive infection prevention in cases of neutropenia."
"Localized bone pain, ulceration, pus discharge, presence of dead bone, cavity formation",Osteomyelitis,"The therapeutic strategies for osteomyelitis primarily include eradication of the infected focus, open cancellous bone grafting, and repeated irrigation, which are the most commonly employed treatments. 
1. Aspiration technique aims to alleviate the pressure in the bone marrow cavity and prevent the spread of inflammation vertically within the cavity by performing puncture and aspiration in the lesion area, alongside the injection of antibiotics into the cavity. 
2. Fenestration drainage technique is employed when radiographic images reveal localized bone destruction and widened bone marrow cavity shadows. By drilling holes or creating a window in the cortical bone at the site of pus accumulation within the bone marrow cavity, this technique helps prevent the spread of inflammation and facilitates the drainage of secretions. Closed irrigation treatment with antibiotics is also performed through the created cavity. 
3. Sequestrectomy involves the removal of dead bone when there's significant necrosis and it's the right moment for surgery, constituting a common and essential surgical method for treating chronic osteomyelitis. 
4. Muscle flap filling technique is applied when there's a large bone cavity eliminating bone voids, and sinus tracts persistently fail to heal. This involves the filling of the defect with nearby healthy muscular and cancellous bone tissue. 
5. Amputation may be considered for severe cases involving multiple foci of osteomyelitis in a limb, combined with numerous sinus tracts, persistent non-healing, or when chronic inflammation stimulates local skin to undergo malignant transformation. 
6. Large-segment dead bone resection is generally suitable for chronic hematogenous osteomyelitis where the diseased bone has significantly hardened, or where there are many local scars and persistent non-healing, especially in certain chronic osteomyelitis patients who do not bear weight or do not have significant functional importance."
"Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, headaches, visual disturbances, and cranial nerve damage",Galactorrhea-Amenorrhea Syndrome,"The treatment options for Galactorrhea-Amenorrhea Syndrome include: 

1. Etiological treatment: Treatment is based on the specific cause. For example, pituitary tumors can be treated surgically or with radiation therapy. Primary hypothyroidism is treated with thyroid hormone replacement. If the syndrome is drug-induced, symptoms typically resolve after discontinuation of the medication. 

2. Pharmacological treatment: 
   a. Bromocriptine (CB1154): A semi-synthetic derivative of ergot alkaloids and a nonspecific dopamine agonist that effectively inhibits prolactin synthesis and secretion. It is preferred over transsphenoidal surgery due to fewer complications, satisfactory reduction in PRL levels, and better recovery of pituitary function. The dosage is based on PRL levels, ranging from 2.5 to 12.5 mg/day, in divided doses, starting with a low dose and gradually increasing to the effective amount. Side effects include gastrointestinal reactions, mild headaches, peripheral vasoconstriction, and orthostatic hypotension, usually subsiding after a few days. A new long-acting injectable form, Parlodel LAR, overcomes gastrointestinal side effects, administered as 50-100 mg every 28 days, starting with 50 mg. Most patients stop lactating after 6-8 weeks and resume menstruation after 8-12 weeks of treatment. 
   b. Pergolide mesylate: A new long-acting ergot-derived dopamine receptor agonist with a starting dose of 25-50 μg/day, adjustably every two weeks, up to a maximum of 150 μg/day. 
   c. Quinagolide (Norprolac or CV205-502): A chiral, novel non-ergot specific dopamine D2 agonist with fewer side effects, stronger and longer action. The dosage is 0.075 mg/day, taken before bedtime. 
   d. Levodopa: Suitable for 'idiopathic galactorrhea-amenorrhea syndrome', ineffective for pituitary tumors. It metabolizes into dopamine in the body, increasing or enhancing the secretion or action of PRIF in the hypothalamus. The dosage is 0.5mg, thrice/day, used for 6-9 months. 
   e. Cabergoline (Dostinex): A partially synthetic ergoline alkaloid derivative and a potent D2 receptor agonist, with a dose of 0.25–1 mg twice weekly, starting with a lower dose and adjusting according to PRL levels every four weeks. 
   f. Vitamin B6: Acts as a coenzyme in the synthesis of dopamine, synergistically enhancing the treatment with dopamine agonists. 
   g. Hormonal therapy with cyclic use of estrogen and progestin may induce menstruation and prevent genital atrophy but has a weak lactation suppression effect. 
   h. Clomiphene: Effective for idiopathic galactorrhea, post-pill amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome, and patients desiring fertility; dosage is 50-100 mg/day for 5 consecutive days to restore normal ovulatory cycles. 
   i. HMG-HCG treatment: Human Menopausal Gonadotropin (HMG) 150U daily by intramuscular injection until follicular maturation, followed by 10,000U of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) intramuscularly to induce ovulation. 

3. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment varies according to syndrome differentiation. 

4. Radiation therapy is an option for tumors that extend beyond the sella turcica, can't be completely removed surgically, for those with persistent hyperprolactinemia post-surgery, for patients who refuse surgery, and for patients with microadenomas, using conventional irradiation, proton beams, alpha particles, and 90Y and 198Au pituitary implants. However, the onset of efficacy is relatively slow, and complications from radiation may include hypogonadism, transient diabetes insipidus, empty sella syndrome, optic nerve damage, transient ophthalmoplegia, brain necrosis, and rarely, malignancies like osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. The effectiveness of radiation therapy in treating amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome may be limited in some cases. 

Prognosis: The prognosis after treatment is generally good."
"Acneiform eruption, pustules, desquamation",Demodicosis,"The treatment of demodicosis includes several approaches:
1. Conventional medicine focuses on acaricidal therapy, reducing sebum production, and alleviating symptoms. Metronidazole is commonly used, although recurrence is frequent.
2. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) usually employs methods to clear and purge the lung and stomach, cool the blood and detoxify, and invigorate the blood to eliminate stasis.
3. Oral administration of metronidazole 0.1g, three times a day, or tinidazole 0.2g, three times a day, for a two-week course, in conjunction with topical applications of 5% sulfur wash or benzoyl peroxide emulsion."
"Reducible swelling in the groin area, pain during urination, urgency, frequency, and enlargement of the scrotum",Inguinal Hernia,"The treatment methods for inguinal hernia include: 
1. Treatment principles are similar to those for oblique hernias. For the elderly or those too frail for surgery due to severe comorbidities, conservative treatment with a truss may be employed; hernia repair surgery; hernioplasty; and supportive symptomatic treatment are also options. 
2. Requirements for hernia repair surgery: Modern surgical techniques aim to meet five basic criteria: minimal post-operative pain, short recovery time for the patient, low hernia recurrence rate, few surgical complications, and prevention of hernia formation in the lower inguinal region of the original hernia area. 
3. Choice of surgical approach: The surgical approach should be selected based on the patient's condition and the type of hernia. The Hernia and Abdominal Wall Surgery Group of the Surgical Society of the Chinese Medical Association suggests the following: 
Type I: High ligation of the hernial sac and repair of the internal ring, or tension-free hernia repair surgery using a mesh (Lichtenstein surgery). 
Type II: Tension-free hernia repair surgery with mesh plug; flat mesh tension-free hernia repair; or, in the absence of synthetic repair materials, procedures such as Bassini, McVay, Halsted, and Shouldice, incorporating tissue relaxation steps wherever possible. 
Type III: Mesh plug tension-free hernia repair; flat mesh tension-free hernia repair; large patch reinforcement of the visceral sac (Stoppa surgery); without synthetic repair materials, the use of autologous materials with attention to tension reduction may be considered. 
Type IV: Mesh plug tension-free hernia repair; large patch reinforcement of the visceral sac. 
Outcomes: Most patients recover from surgery, but there is a 4%–10% recurrence rate."
"Papules, nodules",Pilomatricoma,"What are the treatment options for pilomatricoma? 
For isolated lesions, surgical excision is the preferred method. Smaller lesions can be effectively treated with electrosurgery, cryotherapy, or laser treatment. However, there is a lack of effective treatment methods for multiple lesions; dermabrasion can be attempted, but it may lead to scarring. The treatment of multiple lesions is challenging; mild electrosurgery or electrocautery can yield better cosmetic results. Smaller skin lesions sometimes can be treated with cryotherapy, and dermabrasion can also achieve a cosmetic effect, though there is a tendency for the lesions to gradually recur. Isolated lesions can be surgically removed."
"Paroxysmal severe coughing, wheezing, low fever, weight loss, fatigue and anorexia, thick sputum, blood-streaked sputum, asthmatic attacks, vomiting, diarrhea",Tropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia,"Treatment options for Tropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia include: 
(1) Treatment 
Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) is the drug of choice, with the dosage regimen being 6–8mg/(kg·day) divided into three oral doses, for a duration of three weeks. Clinical symptoms, elevated peripheral blood and BALF eosinophil counts, as well as abnormal pulmonary X-ray changes often improve within 7–10 days after the initiation of treatment. Approximately 20% of cases may relapse, in which case the dosage of DEC can be increased and the course of treatment appropriately extended, such as 8–12mg/(kg·day) for 3–4 weeks. For patients who do not respond to DEC treatment, alternative anthelmintic medications such as albendazole or levamisole can be considered. 
(2) Prognosis 
Maintain a healthy lifestyle and pay attention to diet."
"Swelling, skin itching, joint pain, fever",Erysipelas,"The treatment options for erysipelas include: 
1. For localized infections, high-dose penicillin is administered via intramuscular injection, 800,000 to 1,600,000 U, twice a day, or circumferential infiltration around the lesion with a mixture of penicillin and procaine hydrochloride. Local applications of water are to be avoided, and topical application of 10% to 20% ichthammol or erysipelas ointment, or alternate-day exposure to ultraviolet light, can be employed. 
2. For diffuse or septicemic infections, in addition to penicillin injections, oral sulfonamides or immunoserum injections may be utilized. 
3. Traditional Chinese Medicine treatments can be referred to under erysipelas. 
Prognosis: Without aggressive intervention, the septicaemic form of erysipelas may lead to death within approximately three months. The localized form generally resolves within 3 to 4 weeks but has a high risk of recurrence."
"Sudden fainting, unconsciousness, and cold limbs in reverse order",Syncope,"The treatment of syncope involves identifying the key patterns of deficiency (虚证) and excess (实证). In cases of excess, symptoms may include sudden fainting, facial flushing, coarse breathing, clenched fists, or phlegm congestion, with a red tongue and yellow-greasy coating, and a forceful pulse. Treatment principles for excess include opening the orifices, transforming phlegm, and clearing foulness to awaken the mind, using aromatic herbs that travel through all the meridians. For deficiency patterns presenting with dizziness, pale complexion, weak breath, or cold limbs, treatment focuses on augmenting qi, rescuing yang, and reviving to awaken the mind. This often requires supplementing qi and nourishing blood, with the possible inclusion of hemostasis and blood transfusion for those with significant blood loss. Additionally, treatment adjustments are made for qi-syncopal and blood-syncopal manifestations, with qi excess syncope involving the use of aromatic herbs to open orifices and relieve obstruction, and blood excess syncope requiring herbs that invigorate blood and descend qi. For deficiency states, significant emphasis is placed on nourishing qi and blood with formulations such as Duxin Tang or Ren Shen Yang Ying Tang to address acute situations. Chronic or underlying conditions may be managed with formulas designed to tonify the spleen and harmonize the liver, or to nourish the heart and calm the spirit. Phlegm syncope, marked by sudden unconsciousness with throat rattles or saliva vomiting, calls for formulations that promote qi movement and phlegm dispersion. In cases of summer syncope, arising from heatstroke, treatment aims to clear summer-heat, augment qi, and revive consciousness using strategies that include moving the patient to a cool place, administering oxygen, and employing Qing Kai Ling Injection or other appropriate formulas to reduce heat and restore consciousness."
"Pain, hypersensitivity, numbness, dull sensation",Neurofibromatosis,"There is no cure for neurofibromatosis. Tumors within the skull such as vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas) or optic nerve gliomas and spinal tumors can be treated surgically. Radiotherapy may be an option for some patients, and antiepileptic drugs can be used to treat seizures. Pregnancy can accelerate the growth of vestibular schwannomas. Ketotifen, an inhibitor of mast cell histamine release, may relieve itchiness and localized tenderness when treated for 30-40 months."
"Itching, burning sensation, pain, and localized swelling and congestion of the glans penis",Balanoposthitis,"Treatment options for balanoposthitis include: 

 1. Topical treatment: Keeping the area clean and avoiding irritants are vital. Local applications of potassium permanganate solutions diluted to 1:5000 for soaking or wet compresses can be used. In cases where pus drainage from the preputial sac is inadequate, a dorsal slit of the prepuce may be performed to facilitate drainage and cleaning. Circumcision may be considered after infection control. 

 2. Specific treatment: For infections with an identified cause, targeted treatments should be applied. For candidal balanoposthitis, topical application of 1%-3% clotrimazole or ketoconazole cream is effective. Oral metronidazole is recommended for Trichomonas vaginalis infections. 

 3. Systemic treatment: Patients with severe infections, suspected necrotizing balanitis, fever, or enlarged inguinal lymph nodes require systemic antibiotic therapy. 

 Prognosis is generally good for patients without serious complications and who receive appropriate treatment."
"Chills, fever, headache",Orbital Cellulitis,"What are the treatments for Orbital Cellulitis? 
 Differential Treatment: 
 1. Wind-Heat in the Orbicularis Muscle Syndrome: Characterized by clear-edged, red, and swollen eyelids, with small vesicles at the margins, accompanied by fever, chills, headache, a red tongue with a thin yellow coating, and a floating and rapid pulse. The treatment principle is to dispel wind, clear heat, and detoxify. 
 2. Heat Toxin in the Orbicularis Muscle Syndrome: Marked by diffused dark red swelling of the eyelids, heavy and painful swelling, scorching pain in the affected area, or a deep hard lump turning soft and forming pus, alongside facial and cheek edema, high fever, thirst with a desire to drink, dark yellow urine, dry stools, a red tongue with a yellow coating, and a forceful and rapid pulse. The treatment principle is to purge fire and detoxify. 
 3. Heat Toxin Invasion Syndrome: Presents with diffuse swelling and burning pain in the head, face, and eyelids, swollen and red sclera, high fever, restlessness leading to delirium, nausea, vomiting, a dark red tongue, and a taut and rapid pulse. The treatment focuses on clearing toxic heat from the nutritive level, detoxification, and opening the orifices."
"Commonly located on the eye face, lateral eyebrow, nasal root, occiput, etc., the cysts are round, soft, painless, not adherent to the skin but may adhere to the deep fascia or bone, making them difficult to move.",Epidermoid Cyst,"What are the treatment options for an epidermoid cyst? 
Surgical excision is recommended. Berger advocates the use of intraoperative hydrocortisone irrigation (100mg/l) to reduce the occurrence of postoperative communicative hydrocephalus. Perioperative intravenous corticosteroids and the use of a large amount of saline irrigation intraoperatively can have a similar effect. Due to the dense cyst wall and severe adhesions with surrounding tissues, it is often necessary to leave a portion of the cyst wall behind; however, if the residual part is small, it does not rule out the possibility of achieving satisfactory results."
"Fatigue, loss of appetite, low fever in the afternoon, night sweats, weight loss, dull pain in the affected area, inability to bend at the waist but rather at the hips and knees",Spinal Tuberculosis,"Treatment of spinal tuberculosis can be categorized into non-surgical and surgical methods. 

1. Non-surgical treatment involves the decision on surgery based on the presence or absence of surgical indications. Even for patients who require surgery, a 2-4 week period of non-surgical treatment is adopted as pre-operative preparation. This includes systemic antitubercular medication and local immobilization. Typically, a combination of two antitubercular drugs is used initially for 3-6 months, followed by a transition to a single antitubercular drug for a total treatment duration of not less than two years. Local immobilization is achieved using a plaster corset (for thoracic and upper lumbar tuberculosis) and a plaster waist belt to one thigh (for lower lumbar tuberculosis), with a fixed period of 3 months during which bed rest is advised. For patients who cannot tolerate plaster immobilization, a custom-made plaster bed for 3 months can be used. 

2. Surgical methods include: 

  a) Incision and drainage of cold abscesses in cases of extensive spread leading to secondary infections and significant systemic toxic symptoms. However, incisions are difficult to heal, and due to the deep location of abscesses, drainage might not be efficient. Daily irrigation of the abscess cavity with 4% isoniazid solution and keeping the sinus tract open is recommended. Care should be taken not to allow foreign objects like rubber tubes or cotton balls to fall into the abscess cavity. Incision and drainage are not recommended for cold abscesses without secondary infection. 

  b) Lesionectomy, enabled by the successful synthesis and extraction of antitubercular drugs since the 1940s to 1950s, is performed with anterior and posterior approaches. The posterior approach is commonly used for thoracic spinal tuberculosis, while the anterior approach is preferred for cervical spinal tuberculosis. Post-operation stabilization with plaster is required for 3-4 months, followed by a decision on whether to remove or continue immobilization. 

  c) Posterior spinal fusion surgery combines posterior pedicle screw systems with anterior lesionectomy to enhance spinal stability, allowing early ambulation. Post-surgery, a plaster corset is fixed for 3-6 months. 

  d) Anterior spinal fusion surgery involves bone grafting and anterior internal fixation concurrently with lesionectomy to achieve immediate spinal stability and facilitate bone graft fusion. 

  e) Orthopedic surgery primarily focuses on correcting kyphotic deformities."
"Nystagmus, generalized skeletal muscle spasm, bradykinesia of hands and feet on both sides",Cerebral Palsy,"What are the treatment methods for cerebral palsy? 
1. Comprehensive rehabilitation treatment includes physical (sports) therapy, which encompasses gross and fine motor skills, balance and coordination training; activities such as crawling, purposeful pointing (nose, ears, etc.), training in grasping and holding objects, sitting up, swaying, supported walking (back against the wall, facing the wall), on-the-spot exercises (bending over to pick up objects, leg lifting training, standing on one leg, on-the-spot jumping), walking, running; and physical therapy, which includes neuro-electrical stimulation, thermotherapy, hydrotherapy; occupational therapy or capability training, though generally, the effect is average. Modern medical treatment methods are as follows: (i) Surgery; (ii) Orthotic devices; (iii) Hydrotherapy, electrotherapy, phototherapy, sonotherapy; (iv) Speech and communication therapy; (v) Motor function therapy; (vi) ADL (Activities of Daily Living) training. 
2. Pharmacotherapy involves oral or injectable medications: neuro-nutritional drugs, muscle relaxants, blood circulation enhancing drugs, etc., including drugs that construct and repair brain tissue (cells), like lecithin (containing phosphatidylcholine, cephalin, sphingomyelin, etc.), which can repair brain cell membrane damage caused by trauma, bleeding, hypoxia, protect nerve cells, accelerate nerve excitation conduction, improve learning and memory functions. Also, drugs that promote DNA synthesis in brain cells, improve brain cells' oxygen utilization rate, improve cerebral energy metabolism, enhance brain function, provide various amino acids needed for brain tissue repair and regeneration, regulate brain nerve activities, such as Gliosartan (brain enzyme lyophilized tablets), Spirulina tablets (capsules), are selected. Plus, actively supplement various vitamins, like 21-Goldvit. Hospitals with the conditions may alternatively choose the following injectables (with the same effect as tablets): Cerebrolysin, Brain peptide, Acetylglutamine, Cytidine diphosphate choline, etc. 
3. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatments including acupuncture (with caution in cerebral palsy patients with high muscle tone), massage therapy, Chinese herbal medicine. 
4. Pediatric cerebral palsy exercise therapy: Child cerebral palsy exercise therapy is based on kinesiology and neurophysiology, using equipment or the therapist's manual techniques or the child's own strength, through active and passive movements, to achieve the recovery and treatment of general and local functions. 
(a) Common goals of child cerebral palsy exercise therapy include making movements in as normal a manner as possible, using both sides of the body, maintaining an extended position while lying, sitting, kneeling, and standing, performing daily life-related movements and activities, and preventing deformities. 
(b) Training goals for different types of child cerebral palsy include for spastic type, relaxing stiff muscles, avoiding spastic postures in movements, preventing deformities; for athetoid type, training gripping actions to stabilize involuntary movements, and if abnormal postural changes are unpredictable, follow the goals for the spastic type; for ataxic type, improving balance in kneeling, standing positions and walking, standing and walking steadily, controlling unstable tremors, especially in both hands."
"Visual impairment, retinal detachment, and distorted vision",Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC),"What are the treatment options for Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC)? 
Recognizing CSC as a self-limiting condition, many ophthalmologists advocate for a conservative treatment approach. One approach involves no treatment, adopting a wait-and-see policy towards the condition; another involves administering patients with 'placebos' such as Vitamin C, Vitamin B1, Rutin, Dibazol, and Creatinine. Given the self-limiting nature of CSC, these treatments seem to also result in satisfactory 'outcomes' for patients. For conservative treatment, most patients experience spontaneous improvement within 4 to 6 months, but there is still about 5% of patients whose condition either persists or worsens, leading to significant vision loss. 
Moreover, laser photocoagulation therapy is a more commonly used treatment method for CSC."
"Ear pain, skin ulceration, purulent discharge",Otitis Externa,"Treatment options for otitis externa include topical therapy. For those with damp-heat congestion in the ear orifice, exhibiting redness, swelling, and thermalgia, it is advisable to use the residue of orally administered Chinese herbal medicine to re-brew and apply the warm extract to the affected ear. Topical application of Coptis ointment, or a mixture of Zijin ingot and Niuhuang Jiedu pills dissolved in boiled water for external application to the reddened and swollen external auditory canal is recommended. In cases of enlarged preauricular or postauricular lymph nodes, a mixture of Zijin ingot and Niuhuang Jiedu pills dissolved in water for external application can be used. Other treatment methodologies include acupuncture therapy: For swelling and pain, acupuncture points such as Hegu, Neiguan, and Shaoshang can be stimulated to reduce swelling and alleviate pain."
"Itching in the nose, sneezing, pale and swollen nasal mucosa, runny clear mucus, coughing",Allergic Rhinitis,"Treatment options for allergic rhinitis include: 1. Avoiding contact with allergens, such as keeping indoor dust mite levels below 20/m2; maintaining indoor relative humidity below 60% to avoid discomfort at lower levels (e.g., below 30%-40%); vacuuming carpets; washing bedding and curtains as dust mite allergens are water-soluble; using air purifiers and vacuum cleaners with filters; and avoiding allergens during specific pollen seasons or from animal fur for those allergic. 2. Pharmacotherapy involves the use of intranasal and oral medications, which may have variable effectiveness among patients. There is no sustained effect after discontinuation, indicating the need for continuous treatment for persistent allergic rhinitis, without rapid development of drug resistance. Intranasal administration has many advantages, allowing high concentrations of medication to directly act on the nasal area, minimizing systemic side effects. However, for patients with other allergic diseases, systemic pharmacotherapy is recommended as intranasal medication is not the best choice. Medications include (1) Antihistamines (Oral or nasal second-generation or newer H1 antihistamines are effective for relieving symptoms like nasal itching, sneezing, and runny nose, suitable for mild intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis. Used in combination with intranasal corticosteroids for moderate-severe allergic rhinitis.) (2) Corticosteroids (Intranasal corticosteroids relieve symptoms like nasal congestion, runny nose, and sneezing. Oral corticosteroids can be used for short-term treatment in severe cases unresponsive or intolerant to intranasal medication.) (3) Leukotriene antagonists (Effective for allergic rhinitis and asthma.) (4) Chromones (Somewhat effective for nasal symptoms; eye drops effective for eye symptoms.) (5) Intranasal decongestants (Relieve nasal congestion, treatment duration should be limited to less than 7 days.) (6) Intranasal anticholinergic drugs (Effectively inhibit runny nose.) (7) Herbal medicines (Effective in alleviating symptoms, with the same treatment principles for children and elderly, but special attention should be paid to avoid adverse effects.) (8) Pregnant patients should use medications cautiously. 3. Immunotherapy, recommended by the World Health Organization, can alter the disease course through induction of clinical and immunological tolerance with long-term effects, preventing the development of allergic diseases. Specific allergen immunotherapy is commonly administered via subcutaneous injections or sublingual delivery, with treatment phases including dose accumulation and maintenance, lasting not less than 2 years, using standardized allergen vaccines, primarily indicated for patients unresponsive to conventional pharmacotherapy. Contraindications include active asthma episode, use of beta-blockers, concurrent autoimmune diseases, pregnancy, and lack of patient understanding of treatment risks and limitations. Adverse reactions may occur. 4. Surgical treatment is indicated for persistent nasal congestion symptoms unimproved by medication or immunotherapy with significant signs affecting life quality, significant anatomical abnormalities of the nasal cavity with functional impairment, and concomitant chronic rhinitis or nasal polyps unresponsive to medication. Surgery is not a routine treatment method for this condition."
"Milk secretion, amenorrhea, menstrual irregularity",Galactorrhea-Amenorrhea Syndrome,"Treatment for Galactorrhea-Amenorrhea Syndrome generally focuses on addressing the underlying causes which often result in elevated prolactin levels, thereby leading to the syndrome. 
1. For those caused by pituitary tumors, such as pituitary microadenomas, or other tumors related to prolactin secretion, surgical removal is recommended if conditions permit; if surgery is not feasible, options include radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and traditional Chinese medicine. 
2. In cases where elevated prolactin levels are induced by certain medications, immediate discontinuation of these drugs is advised, with symptoms typically subsiding afterward. 
3. If the syndrome is due to hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis dysfunction leading to elevated prolactin levels, medication aimed at adjusting this functional system should be administered to decrease prolactin levels and restore normal ovulation and menstruation. Drugs like bromocriptine, which targets cells in the pituitary gland secreting prolactin, and Levodopa, which primarily acts on the hypothalamus enhancing the action of prolactin-inhibiting factors, are utilized with dosage strictly following the doctor's prescription. Menstruation can often be restored within 1 month to several months of medication, though side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and dizziness may occur. 
4. For those caused by hypothyroidism, oral administration of thyroid hormone is appropriate, with dosage following medical advice. 
5. Traditional Chinese medicine can effectively adjust the functional status of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, reducing prolactin secretion levels. Not only does it improve symptoms, but it also adjusts the body's internal environment, avoiding the side effects of Western medicine treatments. For those with qi and blood deficiency, treatments like replenishing qi and nourishing blood with modified Ginseng Nourishing Decoction can be applied; for those with liver qi stagnation, treatments like soothing the liver and regulating qi, promoting qi circulation and blood activation with a combination of Xiao Yao San and Tao Hong Si Wu Tang can be used. It's essential that treatment with traditional Chinese medicine is predicated on accurate diagnosis, and in the presence of organic lesions such as pituitary tumors, surgical intervention should not be delayed."
"Characterized by erythematous papules and plaques on the extensor surfaces of the extremities, upper trunk, and upper thighs, presenting in a bilateral symmetrical distribution",Pruritic Urticarial Papules and Plaques of Pregnancy (PUPPP),"Treatment options for Pruritic Urticarial Papules and Plaques of Pregnancy (PUPPP) include: 
1. Advising patients to maintain a regular lifestyle, take frequent showers to keep the skin clean, and avoid consuming spicy and irritating foods. 

2. Glucocorticoids have been shown to be effective for severe cases of PUPPP and can reduce the occurrence of stillbirth. Pregnant women should use these medications for the shortest possible duration, often choosing prednisone 40mg/day, with the course being shortened as much as possible. Dosages should be gradually reduced as symptoms significantly diminish until completely stopped. Glucocorticoids should not be used post-delivery. 

3. For itch relief, topical applications may be used, including a glycerin/sodium chloride (compound glycerin) wash (glycerin 28ml, 95% ethanol 14ml, topped up with distilled water to 100ml), an anti-itch tincture (liquefied phenol 1g, menthol 1g, salicylic acid 2g, 75% ethanol made up to 100ml), and calamine lotion (calamine 15g, zinc oxide 10g, glycerin 20ml, calcium hydroxide solution 100ml). 

4. Antihistamines are commonly prescribed; diphenhydramine 25mg 3-4 times/day post-meal; chlorphenamine 4mg, thrice daily by mouth."
"General joint pain, fever, headache",Osteomyelitis,"What are the treatment methods for Osteomyelitis? The focus for Osteomyelitis prevention involves the elimination of infection sources and interruption of transmission pathways to effectively prevent the disease. In terms of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment for Osteomyelitis, there is currently no available information. For Western medicine treatment, systemic therapy is primarily used. The primary medication is Benzylpenicillin, with a total dose recommendation of 6 million units: an initial intramuscular injection of 300,000 units followed by 600,000 units each time, twice a day via intramuscular injections. Local symptomatic treatment can be applied to the affected limb. This includes timely wound cleaning and dressing changes, and the temporary use of an external fixation brace to immobilize the limb and alleviate pain. Generally, bone lesions can disappear after treatment during the active phase, with minor cases showing normal bone X-rays. In severe cases, residual bone deformities and osteophyte sclerosis may occur. However, pain generally subsides quickly."
"Skin itching, skin pain, localized skin heat",Demodicosis,"For the treatment of demodicosis, the initial step is to avoid environments infested with mites, and to change clothing and bathe in a timely manner. Topical application of anti-inflammatory and antipruritic medications, such as 1% phenol or calamine lotion, 20% osthole, ethanol, etc., is recommended. In cases where the rash is widespread and inflammation is significant, antihistamines or corticosteroids may be administered. For intestinal acariasis, pulmonary acariasis, or urinary tract infections caused by dust mites, oral chloroquine can be prescribed."
"Eczematous skin lesions, pale red scaling patches, exudation and erosion, no obvious itching, ulceration",Paget's Disease of the Breast,"What are the treatment options for Paget's Disease of the Breast?
    Treatment Principles
        1. For Paget’s disease of the breast without evidence of invasive cancer, simple mastectomy may be performed. If breast cancer is present, it is treated according to breast cancer protocols.
        2. For extramammary Paget’s disease, wide local excision is recommended. The excised tissue should be examined pathologically to determine complete removal, and regular follow-up exams (every 3 months) are advised. If associated with rectal, cervical, or apocrine gland cancer, treatment should be integrated based on the type of tumor.
        3. Radiotherapy is often used for cases where surgery is not tolerable or feasible. Basic medication A Pharmacopoeial medications B Novel and special medication C
    Medication Principles
        No confirmed effective medications are identified for Paget’s disease. Symptomatic treatment is applied when surgery is not an option.

"Gunner's wrist deformity, forked wrist deformity, bruising, tenderness, pain",Radial Head Fracture,"The treatment options for radial head fractures include: For crack fractures, immobilization in the short term is followed by early mobilization. For those with minimal displacement, traction in extension and rotation of the forearm in pronation help in restoring the radial head to its round or near-round shape, thus avoiding interference with forearm rotation. After reduction, the fracture is immobilized with a plaster cast. The cast is removed after 2 to 3 weeks, followed by exercises for elbow joint mobility. For comminuted fractures with displacement or unsatisfactory reduction, early radial head resection surgery should be considered, limited to adult patients only. The resection should not be lower than the joint surface of the radial tuberosity. After smoothing the cut end and removing the surrounding fragmented bones, the surrounding soft tissue is sutured over the rough surface of the radial stump. A sling is used to suspend the elbow joint in a functional position postoperatively, and activities can begin after 2 weeks."
"Translucent papules, skin lesions located on the face",Syringoma,"The treatment options for Syringoma are as follows: This condition’s etiology is unknown, and there are no curative treatments targeting the cause. Lesions smaller than 1cm may not require intervention. For solitary lesions, excision, electrodessication, or cryotherapy can be performed. Topically, 1% Atropine or 0.01% Scopolamine butylbromide ointment can be applied once per day. For cysts with concurrent infections, incision and drainage should be performed, accompanied by intravenous antibiotic therapy to treat the infection. Prognosis: The number and visibility of skin lesions increase with hotter temperatures and decrease or lessen during winter."
"Pustules, ulcers, lymph node enlargement, papules",Pyoderma Gangrenosum,"The treatment methods for Pyoderma Gangrenosum include the following: Initially, a 2% iodine solution can be applied topically once a day to keep the area clean. For furuncles, high osmolarity saline or saline soaked gauze with antibiotics should be used for continuous moist dressing to promote the localization, softening, and bursting of the early stages of the infection. Incision and drainage should be considered only when acute inflammation is controlled, swelling is localized, and a clear subcutaneous abscess has formed but has not burst for a long time, focusing on the thin-skinned center of the abscess without separating the abscess cavity. After rupturing or incising for drainage, continue the use of high osmolarity saline soaked gauze for moist dressing to achieve good drainage, ensuring timely replacement of the soaked gauze. The moist dressing should continue until the pus discharge ceases and the wound surface starts to heal. Stopping the moist dressing too early can cause the condition to worsen due to blocked pus drainage. Sometimes, if the pus cannot be easily drained, tweezers can be used gently to assist, but force should not be used on undetached pus or necrotic tissue to prevent tearing and spread of infection. For facial furuncles accompanied by local cellulitis and facial carbuncles, systemic antimicrobial medications should be administered. It is advisable to conduct bacterial culture and sensitivity tests from the pus to choose the appropriate antibiotic accurately. If sepsis is suspected, repeated blood cultures should be done, and medication should be chosen based on the results. If the causative agent is not immediately identified, medications sensitive to Staphylococcus aureus such as penicillin, new-generation penicillins, cephalosporins, and erythromycin can be temporarily used. Broad-spectrum antibiotics may also be considered, potentially in combination for a better effect. Severe cases should receive comprehensive supportive treatment, including bed rest, improved nutrition, fluids or small volume blood transfusions. In cases of septic shock, comprehensive measures should be swiftly taken to correct hypotension resulting from circulatory failure. For patients in coma or with severe pulmonary complications, where there is an excess of respiratory secretions and poor cough reflex, a tracheotomy may be performed to facilitate suction of secretions and improve oxygenation."
"Amenorrhea, secondary amenorrhea, Cushing's syndrome, pelvic mass, headache, vulvar atrophy, nipple discharge, scanty menstruation",Galactorrhea,"Treatment options for Galactorrhea include: 

1. Medication: 
   a. Thyroxine for primary hypothyroidism-induced cases: Replacement therapy with thyroxine leads to cessation of lactation and resumption of normal menstruation. 
   b. Bromocriptine: A dopamine agonist acting on hypothalamic dopamine receptors and directly on pituitary lactotroph cells, alleviating PRL blockade and restoring normal ovulatory cycles. Initially, 1.25 mg twice daily, increased to 2.5 mg 2-3 times daily. For large pituitary adenomas, initial doses of 7.5-12 mg, with a total dose range of 75-950 mg. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and gastric discomfort, which generally improve after the first week of treatment. Discontinuation or post-pregnancy may lead to recurrence, but medication remains effective upon reinstatement. If pregnancy is diagnosed during treatment, medication should be immediately discontinued to prevent fetal malformations, although no fetal abnormalities have been reported in early pregnancy exposures. 
   c. Levodopa (L-dopa) for non-pituitary tumor-induced cases enhances the inhibitory effect of hypothalamic prolactin inhibitory factor, reducing prolactin levels. Typical dosage is 0.5 mg three times daily for six months, with the most common side effects being nausea and vomiting. Symptoms may recur after discontinuation. 
   d. Gonadotropin therapy: Enhances ovarian function and restores hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis physiological function. Use HMG injections, containing both FSH and LH, 75 U daily for 7-10 days until sufficient estrogenic activity is observed or estrogen levels reach 300 pg/ml or 50 ng/24h, indicating follicle maturity. Follow with hCG 2000 U for 2-3 days to induce ovulation. 
   e. CB-153: Similar to dienestrol. CB-153 capsules, one in the morning and one at night. 
   f. Clomiphene: Restores full hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis function and induces ovulation. Start on the fifth day of a natural or induced menstrual cycle, 50 mg once daily for five days. 
   g. Vitamin B6: Acts as a coenzyme for dopamine decarboxylase, facilitating conversion of dopamine in hypothalamic neurons, stimulating PIF activity, and suppressing PRL secretion. Dosage: 200-600 mg daily for extended periods. 

2. Radiotherapy (Chemotherapy): 
   Applies only to patients who have failed other treatments and exhibit progressive disease. Main concern is pituitary function decline in the years following treatment. Ongoing endocrine function monitoring (at least annually) and sella turcica evaluation are required after treating large adenomas. 

3. Surgical Treatment: 
   Indicated for large pituitary adenomas (diameter > 3 cm), craniopharyngiomas, and hyperthyroidism-induced galactorrhea. Surgical intervention is considered."
"Bone lesions, pain, functional impairment",Fibrous Dysplasia,"What are the treatment options for Fibrous Dysplasia? 
Treatment for Fibrous Dysplasia can be divided into two main approaches: one targeting the lesion itself and the other addressing fractures and deformities caused by the lesion. Currently, there are no ideal treatments at the genetic level. As a congenital disease, asymptomatic lesions generally do not require treatment."
"Intolerance to cold, hot, sour, and sweet foods; toothache",Dental Caries,"The objectives of treating dental caries are to halt the disease process, prevent further progression, and restore the tooth's natural form and function. Due to the unique structure of teeth, while they have remineralization capabilities, they lack the ability to self-repair substantial defects. Except for a few cases where medications can be utilized, treatments generally involve restorative procedures such as fillings, inlays, or crowns based on the extent and volume of the tooth defect, to restore shape and function. 1. Medication Treatment: This involves applying medication to inhibit the progression of dental caries, suitable for shallow caries in permanent teeth and anterior deciduous teeth. Common medications include silver diamine fluoride and sodium fluoride. The process includes removing decayed tissue as much as possible, isolating saliva with a cotton roll, drying the tooth surface, applying silver diamine fluoride solution with a small cotton ball for 1-2 minutes, drying it with a warm air gun, and repeating the application. Then, a cotton ball dipped in clove oil is used for application, turning it back to black color, and drying to complete the treatment. This blocks the dental tubules with silver deposits, preventing caries progression. Treatments are usually conducted once a week, with 3-4 sessions as one course of treatment, and a follow-up every 3-6 months is recommended to prevent soft tissue burns. 2. Amalgam Filling: For teeth with substantial defects, amalgam filling is a widely used and effective method. It involves removing decayed and weak tooth structure, forming the cavity into a specific shape, and then filling it with amalgam to restore its natural form and function, appropriate for posterior fillings and concealed areas in anterior teeth. Stages include removing decayed tissue, forming the cavity for resistance and retention, cleaning and disinfecting the cavity, applying a base, filling it with amalgam, and polishing. 3. Composite Resin Filling: Suitable for anterior teeth and non-load bearing posterior teeth. Key points include preparing a specific cavity shape, applying a base for moderate to deep cavities, using clean and dry mixing instruments with a non-metal spatula, ensuring proper component ratio, and mixing well. The filling process should avoid moisture to prevent bubble formation and use polyester strip or glass ionomer to compress the material, followed by shaping and polishing. 4. Acid-Etching Photocured Composite Resin Filling: Used for the same indications as composite resin filling, also suitable for teeth with extensive defects, poor retention, or discoloration. The process involves thoroughly cleaning the tooth surface, covering exposed dentin with zinc phosphate cement or calcium hydroxide, acid-etching with 35% or 50% phosphoric acid for 1-2 minutes, thoroughly rinsing and drying the tooth surface, applying adhesive, filling with photocured composite resin, curing with visible light for 20-40 seconds, and finally, shaping and polishing. 5. Inlays: Made of metal or other materials fitting into the tooth cavity and serve as an inlay; those covering the occlusal surface are called onlays. Indications include large occlusal cavities in posterior teeth or teeth at risk of fracturing, interproximal cavities that cannot be restored with fillings, and as abutments for partial fixed bridges. Key steps involve removing decay and unsupported enamel, ensuring a minimum depth of 2.5mm with a 45° cavosurface margin, and an external cavity wall angle less than 5°. Additional retention features such as pins or grooves may be added, and for teeth with thin walls or weak cusps, a full occlusal preparation is advised. A model wax pattern is created, embedded promptly, and a lost-wax casting method is typically used."
"Mild fever, night sweats, fatigue, loss of appetite, coughing, chest pain",Paragonimiasis,"Treatment options for Paragonimiasis include several approaches. Prevention measures are critical, including widespread health education to avoid consuming raw or undercooked crabs or crayfish, not drinking unboiled water, and strict management of sputum and feces to eliminate the disease carriers and break the transmission chain. Measures should be taken to eliminate snails, stone crabs, and crayfish in endemic areas. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment strategies include: 1. For Cold-Damp Obstruction syndrome: chills without sweating, dizzy headache, tasteless food intake, abdominal bloating and pain, diarrhea with borborygmus, pale-red tongue with a white coating, and a soggy-fast pulse. Treatment involves dispelling cold and eliminating dampness, with modifications to Huoxiang Zhengqi Powder. 2. For Worm-Toxin Invading Lung syndrome: cough, chest stuffiness and pain, expectoration of pus-like or rusty sputum, or even coughing up fresh blood, irritability, dry mouth, red tongue with yellow greasy coating, and a slippery-fast pulse. Treatment involves clearing the lungs, transforming phlegm, killing parasites, and stopping bleeding. Reed Stem Soup with added areca nut, Herba Siegesbeckiae, etc., is used. 3. For Phlegm-Worm Intertwining syndrome: deep muscle nodules between the lower abdomen and thighs, possibly connected in series, slightly painful and itchy when pressed, or soft to hard masses on the abdomen, chest, groin, and even the head and neck, with unclear boundaries. Treatment targets killing parasites, transforming phlegm, softening hardness, and dispersing nodules. Guide Phlegm Decoction combined with Xiao Lu Wan, plus areca nut, thunder god vine seeds, etc., is recommended. 4. For Worm-Toxin Invading Brain syndrome: fixed headache, vomiting, slow response, or epileptic seizures, sudden fainting with froth at the mouth, limbs twitching, or hemiplegia with stumbling speech. The treatment aims to eliminate phlegm, open orifices, kill parasites, and extinguish wind. Ditan Decoction plus areca nut, Pediculus Capitis, Bidens, Gastrodia Elata, among others, is used. Western medicine treatment for Paragonimiasis includes: 1. Etiological Treatment: (a) Bithionol is the drug of choice with low toxicity, good oral absorption, a short-term cure rate of 84%–100%, and a long-term efficacy rate of 80%–90%. Adults are administered 1g, orally three times a day or every other day, for a treatment cycle of 10–20 days. Cerebral cases may require 2–3 repeated courses. Side effects include dizziness, headache, gastrointestinal reactions, rashes, and occasional Herxheimer reaction. Liver damage warrants drug cessation. Contraindicated in severe heart, renal diseases, and pregnancy. (b) Praziquantel offers high efficacy, short treatment duration, convenient administration, and minimal side effects like mild dizziness, headache, and fatigue. Dosage: 25mg/kg per dose, three times a day, orally, for 2–3 consecutive days with a week's interval before another cycle for cerebral cases. (c) Triclabendazole demonstrates good efficacy with a dose of 30 mg–50 mg/kg, daily or every other day, for 10–15 days per course. Side effects include gastrointestinal reactions, headache, dizziness, rare acute hemolytic anemia, and mental disturbances. Contraindicated in individuals with psychiatric history, severe liver or kidney disease, and pregnant women. (d) Albendazole: Administered at 8mg/kg (not exceeding 400mg at once), split into two doses daily, for 7 consecutive days. 2. Secondary bacterial infections should be managed with antibiotics. 3. For chronic cerebral or spinal types with compression symptoms unresponsive to drug treatment, surgical intervention may be considered."
"Oral mucosal leukoplakia, hairy leukoplakia on both sides of the tongue, burning sensation in the mouth and pharynx, symmetrical occurrence of lesions on the buccal mucosa and corners of the mouth, Candida infection often accompanies leukoplakia at the corners of the mouth, simple mucosal leukoplakia is rare and often covered with crusts.",Oral Leukoplakia,"What are the treatment methods for oral leukoplakia? 
(1) Treatment: 
   1. Most cases of mucosal leukoplakia do not require treatment. 
   2. Remove local irritants, such as improving oral hygiene, quitting smoking, treating diseased teeth, and limiting the intake of spicy and irritating food. Most leukoplakia related to smoking retract after cessation of smoking. 
   3. Treat concomitant systemic diseases. Vitamin A can be administered, 50,000 units per day, by intramuscular injection, or vitamin B12 injections. 
   4. Local treatment includes cauterization with pure silver nitrate or chromic acid, or laser excision. It is essential to reach deep into the mucosal layer, especially for leukoplakia on the tongue, which should be excised as early as possible. 
   5. At least an annual check-up until the lesion retracts. If the epithelium of the leukoplakia is dysplastic or the lesion does not retract, consider surgical excision. 
   6. Large leukoplakia areas may undergo free skin grafting after excision to cover the wound, or cryotherapy and laser treatment. 
   Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment: The appropriate approach is to clear heat and detoxify, and to promote blood circulation to remove blood stasis. The combined formula of Detoxifying and Heat-Clearing Soup and Blood-Activating and Stasis-Resolving Soup is used with modifications. 
(2) Prognosis: 
   Recent studies have shown that 4% to 6% of mucosal leukoplakia may transform into malignant tumors."
"Growth disorders, short stature, proportionate body, intelligence corresponding to age",Dwarfism,"Treatment options for dwarfism vary based on the underlying cause and include: 

1. Etiological treatment, targeting the specific cause of the condition. 

2. Supportive measures such as nutrition, exercise, and psychological therapy. 

3. Hormone replacement therapy, administering the deficient hormone. This includes: 
    (a) Growth Hormone (GH) therapy is indicated for those with GH deficiency, intrauterine growth retardation, idiopathic short stature, congenital chondrodysplasia, and in cases where there's a strong preference for treatment in familial short stature. Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) is widely used, typically administered as a subcutaneous injection at a dose of 0.1U/(kg·day) before bedtime, 6-7 times a week, continuing until epiphyseal closure. Younger ages see better outcomes, with the first year showing the most significant growth, potentially exceeding 10cm, though the rate decreases subsequently. During rhGH therapy, thyroid hormone deficiency may occur, necessitating thyroid function monitoring and, if needed, concurrent thyroid hormone replacement. 
    Side effects of rhGH are minimal, including local injection site reactions, antibody formation months after starting treatment without significant impact on growth promotion, rare temporary papilledema or intracranial hypertension, and a low risk of increased incidences of femoral epiphysis slippage and necrosis. rhGH is contraindicated in individuals with malignancies or at risk of malignant transformation and in patients with severe diabetes. 

    (b) Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone (GHRH) can be effective, especially in GH deficiency of hypothalamic origin, by administering 8-30ug/kg daily, either in two divided subcutaneous injections or a 24-hour continuous infusion via a subcutaneous pump. However, it is ineffective in pituitary GH deficiency. 

    (c) Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) therapy for GH insensitivity or resistance syndromes. 

    (d) Oral anabolic steroids, including Fluoxymesterone 2.5mg/m2 daily, Methyltestosterone 0.1-0.25mg/kg daily, or Oxandrolone 0.05mg/kg daily. These are derivatives of androgens with strong anabolic and weak androgenic effects, hastening skeletal maturation but may cause masculinization, hence the need for careful skeletal monitoring. The use of Nandrolone phenylpropionate is currently less common. 

Patients with GH deficiency and associated gonadal axis dysfunction may begin sex hormone therapy when bone age reaches 12 years, males with Testosterone undecanoate 25mg monthly, increasing by 25mg every three months to 100mg monthly; females may use Ethinylestradiol 1-2ug/day, or Conjugated Estrogens (Premarin) starting from 0.3mg/day with gradual adjustments, also monitoring bone age."
"Nodules, skin adhesion",Pilomatricoma,"What are the treatment methods for Pilomatricoma? 
(1) Treatment 
  1. Surgical excision biopsy is the best treatment method. Alternatively, small incision curettage can be performed to scrape out the cyst contents. Complete surgical removal rarely results in recurrence. 
  2. Combined with traditional Chinese medicine regulation, aiming to strengthen the body's foundation and improve spleen and kidney functions. Treatment follows the principles of integrating disease identification and syndrome differentiation, combining systemic and local treatments, and harmonizing qi-nourishment and blood-tonifying with anti-cancer measures. According to the Yao medicine theory of syndrome differentiation and treatment, it uses the unique properties of Chinese herbal medicine to adjust the body's excess or deficiency, supplementing where necessary and reducing where excessive, to achieve a balance of qi and blood, yin and yang, ensuring the vitality of life. 
(2) Prognosis 
  A few cases may malignantly transform into pilomatrix carcinoma. Early surgical removal offers a better prognosis."
"Excessive sweating, night terrors, easy crying, hair loss in patches, and ring-shaped hair loss.",Rickets,"What are the treatment methods for Rickets? 
Western medicine treatments include: 
1. For nutritional rickets and osteomalacia, daily treatment with 1000-10000 IU of Vitamin D and 1g of elemental calcium can achieve good therapeutic effects. 1g of elemental calcium is equivalent to 8g of calcium lactate, 5.5g of calcium hydroxide, or 11g of calcium gluconate. 
2. For rickets and osteomalacia due to malabsorption, the treatment mainly targets intestinal diseases, while also supplementing daily with 1500-2500 IU of Vitamin D and 1-2g of elemental calcium. 
3. For hypophosphatemic rickets resistant to Vitamin D and osteomalacia, patients should supplement daily with 1-3g of phosphorus, and due to resistance to standard doses of Vitamin D, 20,000-50,000 IU or more of Vitamin D daily. 
4. For tumors of the bone and soft tissue with hypophosphatemic rickets and osteomalacia, removing the tumor can rapidly normalize bone metabolism. 
5. For Fanconi syndrome, treatment can include daily Vitamin D 20,000-50,000 IU, elemental calcium 1g, phosphorus 1-2g, along with correcting acidosis, hypokalemia, and dehydration. 
6. For rickets and osteomalacia caused by renal tubular acidosis, the main treatment is to correct acidosis and hypokalemia, while also administering daily 10,000-50,000 IU of Vitamin D, being careful to prevent Vitamin D overdose. 
7. For renal osteodystrophy causing rickets and osteomalacia, treatment should focus on managing kidney disease, while also reducing phosphate intake, administering oral aluminum hydroxide to reduce phosphate absorption, and daily providing 20,000-200,000 IU of Vitamin D and 1.0-3.0g of elemental calcium. Recently, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 and its analogues, 10α-hydroxy Vitamin D3, have begun to be clinically used, especially useful for Vitamin D-resistant rickets or osteomalacia, particularly in renal osteodystrophy. Its advantage is the ease of dose control, with blood calcium levels dropping 1-2 days after stopping the medication, compared to the months it takes for blood calcium to gradually decrease after stopping large doses of Vitamin D. 
8. For antiepileptic drug-induced rickets and osteomalacia, this bone disease responds well to moderate doses of Vitamin D. 
Traditional Chinese medicine treatments include: 
1. For spleen-lung qi deficiency: Strengthen the spleen and boost qi with modified Guipi Tang. 
2. For kidney essence deficiency: Nourish the kidney and augment essence with modified Liuwei Dihuang Pill. 
3. For kidney deficiency and marrow insufficiency: Nourish the kidney and fill the marrow with modified Jingui Shenqi Pill. 
Integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatments: 
1. Engage in more outdoor activities, sun exposure, pay attention to adding complementary foods, and consume foods rich in Vitamin D. 
2. Based on the severity of the condition, Vitamin D supplements should be used, along with appropriate calcium supplements. 
3. Internal remedies such as Longmu Zhuanggu drink and roasted eggshell powder can be taken. 
4. For those with skeletal deformities, physical exercises should be strengthened, and in severe cases, orthopedic surgeries may be considered at the appropriate time."
"Chills, fever, chest pain, cough, rust-colored sputum, rapid breathing, general body aches, possible nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, and diarrhea",Pneumococcal Pneumonia,"Treatment options for pneumococcal pneumonia include:
1. Antimicrobial therapy should be initiated as early as possible. Penicillin G at a dosage of 800,000 to 2,000,000 Units by intramuscular injection every 12 hours; in cases of shock, intravenous administration is recommended, with a treatment duration of at least 1 week, or until the temperature normalizes for 72 hours. Early discontinuation may lead to relapse. If the patient is able to take oral medication and injections are not suitable, an initial dose of procaine penicillin followed by oral Penicillin V, at least 250mg every 6 hours, is advised. Penicillin therapy is significantly effective, with bacteremia cleared in a few hours; over half of the patients may experience a rapid drop to normal body temperature within 48 hours, followed by a temporary low fever lasting hours to days before normalization; others may have a slower fever resolution, typically returning to normal within 4 to 7 days. If patient response to penicillin is suboptimal, potential reasons include concurrent empyema, endocarditis, meningitis, tumor-induced lung suppuration; infections caused by other bacteria or drug-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (notably, a multi-drug resistant strain appeared in South Africa in 1977); drug fever due to penicillin allergy; or incorrect diagnosis. Sometimes, initial treatments are effective, but later treatments are not, possibly due to a mixed infection with both sensitive and resistant bacterial strains. In such cases, reevaluation of the bacterial species and their sensitivities to antimicrobial drugs is necessary. Mixed infections are more common in patients with pre-existing chronic lung diseases. For patients allergic to penicillin, alternative antimicrobials include:
a. Cefotaxime: 1g every 4 hours by intramuscular or intravenous injection, although cross-allergy with penicillin is rare, a Cefotaxime sensitivity test is advised before use.
b. Ceftriaxone: 0.5g every 6 hours by intramuscular or intravenous administration.
c. Erythromycin: 0.25g orally every 6 hours, with resistance being rare.
d. Tetracycline resistance in pneumococcal strains has exceeded 5%; unless local strain sensitivity to tetracycline is confirmed, it is not recommended.
e. Streptococcus pneumoniae generally exhibits low sensitivity to gentamicin, and it is not commonly used.
2. Supportive and symptomatic therapy includes bed rest, a liquid diet transitioning to a semi-liquid or soft diet upon improvement, and supplementation of fluids and electrolytes to maintain urine specific gravity below 1.020. For patients in shock, oxygen supplementation, circulatory volume restoration, and correction of acidosis are crucial; intravenous administration of 0.3% hydrogen peroxide, phenylephrine, scopolamine, atropine, or isoproterenol may improve microcirculation; indiscriminate use of vasopressor agents should be avoided. Patients with a prognosis considered more severe include the elderly and infants; cases of delayed treatment; infections by serotypes 2 and 3 of Streptococcus pneumoniae; multilobar involvement; significant leukopenia; bacteremia; detection of capsular polysaccharide antigen in blood by counterimmunoelectrophoresis; significant jaundice; complications of shock, endocarditis, meningitis; late-stage pregnancy; primary chronic diseases of the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, or reduced cellular immunity; alcohol abuse, and presentations with tremors or delirium. A chest X-ray is recommended 3 to 4 weeks after recovery."
"Frequent urination, hard stool, constipation for days, dry mouth and bad breath, abdominal bloating",Constipation,"What are the treatment methods for constipation?
Treatment Principle: Clear heat, moisten the intestines, and gently stimulate bowel movement.
(1) Oral Medications:
1. Basic Formula: Ma Zi Ren Pills: Huo Ma Ren (Cannabis Seeds) 60g, Bai Shao (White Peony Root) 20g, Zhi Shi (Immature Bitter Orange) 30g, Da Huang (Rhubarb) 60g, Hou Po (Magnolia Bark) 30g, Xing Ren (Apricot Kernel) 30g, with an appropriate amount of honey. Grind the first six ingredients into a fine powder, mix with refined honey to form pills about the size of a Wutong (Parasol Tree) seed. Take 10 pills each time, 2-3 times a day with warm water. For those with unrelieved constipation, gradually increase the dosage until defecation is achieved. If patent medicines are unavailable, the pill formula can be altered to a decoction formula with Ma Ren 10g, Bai Shao 12g, Zhi Shi 10g, Da Huang 10g (add later), Hou Po 10g, Xing Ren 12g, taken as one dose daily. Boil and reduce to 300ml, divide into 2-3 doses, taken warm. Add an appropriate amount of white honey to the decoction at the time of taking.
2. Modifications: For stools that are dry and hard like sheep feces, add Mang Xiao (Mirabilite) 12g; For dry mouth and throat, red tongue with little fluid, add Sheng Di Huang (Rehmannia) 15g, Yuan Shen (Radix Farfarae) 15g, Shi Hu (Dendrobium) 10g, Mai Dong (Ophiopogon) 10g, Sha Shen (Glehnia) 15g; For bleeding hemorrhoids, add Jue Ming Zi (Cassia Seed) 12g, and raw Di Yu (Sanguisorba Officinalis) 10g; For bitterness in mouth, dry throat, red eyes, and irritability add Long Dan Cao (Gentian) 10g, Huang Qin (Baical Skullcap) 10g, or take Geng Yi Wan separately.
(2) Topical Applications:
1. 5-6 snails with shells, crushed into a paste with 0.3g of musk, applied to the Shenque (CV8) acupuncture point, covered with oil paper or plastic film, and secured with medical adhesive tape. Apply once a day.
2. 50g of chopped spring onion, mashed into a paste, mixed with an appropriate amount of vinegar and heated, applied to the Shenque (CV8) acupuncture point, and ironed with a hot water bag, 3 times a day, 30 minutes each time.
(3) Moistening and Guiding Method:
1. Pig Bile Guiding Method: Obtain bile from a large pig's gallbladder, mix with a small amount of food vinegar, and instill into the anus. Use when there's an urgent need for defecation.
2. Laxative Sticks: Xi Xin (Asarum) 12g, Zao Jiao (Chinese Honeylocust Spine) 12g, honey 120g. First, grind Xi Xin and Zao Jiao into powder; then heat honey in a pot over low heat until droplets form beads. Mix in the powder, and when slightly warm, shape into suppositories about 5cm in length and 1cm in diameter, slightly pointed at one end, to be used by inserting 1-2 sticks into the anus once a day.
3. Honey Fry Guiding Method: An appropriate amount of white honey is simmered on low heat until it becomes a gel, then, while slightly warm, is rolled into a finger-sized shape, about 6cm long, with a small and round head and slightly thicker tail, to be used as a suppository; it is inserted into the anus when there is an urge to defecate but cannot, once a day.
Treatment Key Points:
(1) The primary concern in this condition is the deficiency of body fluids. While there might be gastrointestinal dry heat causing obstruction, the condition has not reached the stage of severe fullness and hardness. The therapeutic approach should primarily focus on moistening dryness, complemented by gentle downward stimulation, ensuring prescriptions stimulate bowel movement without being too harsh or greasy. Care must be taken not to excessively use bitter, cold, and purgative agents that could further injure the Yin fluids.
(2) Although Ma Zi Ren Pills are intended to moisten and stimulate bowel movement, the formula still contains Da Huang, Zhi Shi, and Hou Po, resembling Xiao Cheng Qi Tang's intention of draining heat, eliminating fullness, moving Qi, and alleviating stagnation, belonging to the methods of clearing and downward movement. Therefore, it is not suitable for prolonged use. If after an adequate period of treatment with Ma Zi Ren Pills, the heat symptoms are alleviated but constipation remains unresolved, it is advisable to switch to formulas that primarily nourish Yin and moisten dryness.
(3) There are various therapeutic methods for this condition. Medication and dietary therapy should be combined, and depending on the situation, methods such as guiding downward movements, and injections may be employed. Adjusting one's emotional state, having a regular schedule for toilet visits, and dietary adjustments are very important. The issue cannot be resolved solely by utilizing purgative methods."
"Mild dragging sensation in the groin, round or pear-shaped mass, and traction pain",Inguinal Hernia,"There are several treatment methods for inguinal hernia: 
Western medicine treatment involves surgical intervention once a diagnosis is made. Historically, it was believed that about half of newborns have an unclosed processus vaginalis compared to only about 20% of adults, leading to the possibility of spontaneous closure in some cases. Hence, for children’s hernias, it was possible to wait for spontaneous healing by tightly bandaging the internal ring with gauze. However, the likelihood of spontaneous healing of indirect hernias is very minimal. On the other hand, as children's indirect hernias are often associated with congenital unclosed processus vaginalis without secondary pathological changes, surgery is considered simple, safe, and effective. Therefore, it is now commonly advocated that surgery should be arranged once a diagnosis is made, with virtually no mortality and a general recurrence rate of less than 1%. Conversely, should strangulation occur, there is a certain mortality rate. Surgery is not suitable for patients with severe diseases, those at high risk, or patients with conditions that increase abdominal pressure, such as prostate enlargement, chronic bronchitis, or hepatic ascites. In order to alleviate symptoms, a hernia belt may be used to press the soft pad of the hernia belt against the internal ring, preventing the hernia from protruding after being returned to the abdominal cavity. However, long-term use of the hernia belt may lead to thickening of the hernia sac wall, atrophy of the surrounding tissue, or scar formation, increasing the difficulty of future surgeries. 
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment: For 'Fox Hernia', the treatment starts with differentiating between cold, heat, deficiency, and excess conditions. For those with cold excess condition, warming meridians and dispersing cold, smoothing liver, and regulating qi are advisable; for those with qi deficiency and prolapse, it’s advisable to strengthen the spleen and boost qi to lift the prolapse. For those with heat conditions, add ingredients that clear heat and promote dampness elimination. 
  Liver Qi Stagnation: Treatment method involves soothing the liver and regulating qi to relieve pain. Prescription includes Bupleurum Liver-Soothing Powder modified with added herbs such as Radix Cyperi, Fructus Aurantii, Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae for qi regulation; Paeoniae Alba Radix and Roasted Licorice for relieving acute pain; Ligusticum Wallichii for promoting blood circulation, reducing swelling, and directing the herbs downward; Szechuan Lovage Root and Corydalis Yanhusuo for qi regulation and pain relief. The combined effects of these herbs provide liver-soothing, qi-regulating, swelling-reducing, and pain-relieving benefits. For hernias caused by liver failing to smooth and disperse, Spider Powder from 'Quan Bin Yao Lu' can be used, with spiders entering the Liver Meridian of Foot Jueyin for reducing swelling and detoxifying, while Cinnamon Twig facilitates Yang movement and dispels depression. 
  Central Qi Prolapse: Treatment method involves boosting qi and lifting prolapse to relieve pain. Prescription includes Ginseng, Astragalus, and Licorice to strengthen the spleen and boost qi; Tangerine Peel and Atractylodes macrocephala to stimulate the spleen and regulate qi; Angelica sinensis to nourish blood and yin, balancing yin and yang. Bupleurum and Hemp Seeds lift prolapse and promote clear qi; Ginger Dates harmonize the nutrient and defense systems; Corydalis Yanhusuo and Szechuan Lovage Root for qi regulation and pain relief. To warm the middle and assist Yang, Prepared Aconite Root and Dried Ginger can be added for those who feel cold and have cold limbs. 
  Cold and Damp Stagnation: Treatment method warms meridians and disperses cold to relieve pain and dampness. Prescription includes Cinnamon, Agilawood, Fennel for warming meridians and dispelling cold; Black Medic and Evodia officinalis for warming the liver and eliminating dampness; Fresh Ginger for reinforcing cold dispersion; Bi Xie and Poria to strengthen the spleen and manage dampness; Angelica and Lycium berries for nourishing blood and reinforcing liver and kidney function. 
Acupuncture: Points like Da Dun, Da Zhong, Qi Hai, and San Yin Jiao are needled using the reducing method. Moxibustion is applied to Guan Yuan and Triangle Moxibustion. Needles are retained for 15-20 minutes for every session, with treatment daily and one course consists of 10 sessions."
"Amenorrhea, Galactorrhea-Amenorrhea-Infertility Syndrome, Secondary Amenorrhea, Decreased Libido, Visual Field Defects, Osteoporosis, Eyelid Ptosis, Nausea and Vomiting, Headache, Male Infertility, Galactorrhea",Prolactinoma,"The treatment of prolactinomas depends on two factors: tumor size and whether symptoms are caused by elevated prolactin (PRL) levels. Medication therapy (dopamine agonists) is the first-line treatment. Domestically, bromocriptine is primarily used, while cabergoline is common internationally. If medication is ineffective or there is drug resistance, transsphenoidal surgery might be considered. Even in cases of large adenomas with symptoms of cranial nerve compression, dopamine agonists may be attempted first, as treatment effects can sometimes appear swiftly. Radiation therapy serves only as an adjunct treatment. Regardless of the treatment approach, PRL levels must be regularly monitored. 

1. Medical Therapy 

Medical therapy is preferred. Bromocriptine, after over two decades of clinical observation, has shown significant efficacy in lowering serum prolactin levels, reducing tumor size, improving visual field deficits, and relieving symptoms of cranial nerve compression, as well as in restoring gonadal function. Currently, several new dopaminergic D2 receptor agonists, such as pergolide, quinagolide, and cabergoline, have become available. 

2. Surgical Treatment 

Surgical treatment mainly involves transsphenoidal surgery, allowing for the selective removal of adenomatous tissue via an oral or nasal-sphenoidal approach, while preserving normal pituitary tissue. However, a complete removal might not be possible for some patients, potentially leading to complications such as cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, diabetes insipidus, intracranial infections, damage to the visual system, and reduced pituitary gland function postoperatively. Surgery may reduce the need for medical therapy and can improve resistance to medication postoperatively. 

3. Radiation Therapy 

Radiation therapy is only an auxiliary measure, used to prevent tumor growth; however, its effect in lowering PRL levels is slow and it is often unsatisfactory in restoring ovulatory menstrual cycles, commonly utilized for those who did not achieve remission after surgery. Complications of pituitary radiation therapy may include hypothalamic dysfunction, impaired pituitary function, damage to the visual system, cerebral vascular accidents, brain necrosis, and secondary brain tumors, either malignant or benign."
"Wheals, abdominal pain, vesicles, neutrophilia, pigment anomaly, fever, papules, fever with rash, angioneurotic edema, urticarial rash, exfoliative dermatitis, joint swelling and pain",Eosinophilia,"What are the treatment options for eosinophilia? 
 Treatment should primarily focus on the underlying cause. If the condition is triggered by an allergic reaction to parasites, no special treatment is necessary once the cause is removed, and the prognosis is good. If there is organ damage, treatment to lower eosinophil counts or block eosinophilic effects is required regardless of the level of eosinophilia. Additional supportive and symptomatic care should also be provided based on the patient's condition. If caused by malignancy or eosinophilic leukemia, the prognosis is poor. Medications and treatment plans for eosinophilia.
 Prognosis depends on the cause. Recovery is possible without special treatment if the cause is removed, such as in cases caused by parasites, allergies, or drugs. However, if it is caused by malignancies or eosinophilic leukemia, the prognosis is poor."
"Cough, rusty sputum, fatigue, abdominal pain, night sweats, splenomegaly, jaundice, hemoptysis, abdominal distension, anemia",Paragonimiasis,"Treatment methods for paragonimiasis include: 1. Prevention of human infection: In endemic areas, broadly disseminate educational materials to abandon the habits of consuming raw or undercooked freshwater crabs and crayfish, and to avoid drinking untreated stream water. 2. Control of infection source: Thorough treatment of infected individuals and domestic animals. Eradicate animals that are harmful to humans or serve as hosts for the parasites. 3. Interruption of transmission pathways: Sanitary management of feces to eliminate parasite eggs in sputum and feces, preventing the eggs from contaminating water bodies. Avoid feeding dogs and cats with raw freshwater crabs and crayfish to prevent domestic animal infections."
"Numbness on the outer part of the thigh, sensations of crawling on the skin, decreased sweating, reduced or absent superficial sensation, reduced pain and temperature sensation while pressure sensation remains, tingling, and sensory impairment.",Meralgia Paresthetica,"The treatment for Meralgia Paresthetica primarily involves identifying and actively treating any underlying condition to alleviate the irritation to the nerve. Additionally, symptomatic treatment may include administration of Vitamin B1, B2, B12, or corticosteroids to nourish the nerves and reduce inflammation. For severe pain, painkillers or local nerve blocks may be administered. In cases where the condition is severe, unresponsive to treatment, and the cause remains undetermined, surgical intervention to cut the nerve or perform neurolysis may be considered."
"Headache, dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, hand tremors, limb numbness, poor sleep, and memory decline",Cerebral Arteriosclerosis,"Treatment options for cerebral arteriosclerosis typically involve medication, as it is a common approach for most vascular diseases of the brain. The medication strategy generally includes the following (consult a doctor for details): 

Correcting lipid metabolism disorders: Choices of medication can include Sodium Alginate 100mg, three times daily; Policosanol 1.0g, three times daily; Ginkgo Biloba Extract 0.9g, three times daily; Atorvastatin 0.25-0.5g, taken post-meal (with potential side effects such as gastrointestinal reactions, skin allergies, increased serum transaminases, and changes in kidney function; caution is advised for patients with poor liver or kidney function); Evening Primrose Oil capsules, two capsules, three times daily; Vitamin C 0.1g, three times daily, or 1g mixed with glucose for daily intravenous drip; Vitamin B6 10-20mg, three times daily, or 50-100mg once daily for a 15-day course; Vitamin E 0.1g, three times daily; Rutin 20mg, three times daily, or in compound form, one tablet three times daily.

Treatment focuses on clearing heat and detoxifying. 
3. Syndrome of Wind-Wheel Yin Deficiency: In this condition, pterygium stabilizes without pain, manifests as dizziness, tinnitus, soreness and weakness in the lumbar and knee regions, red tongue without coating, and a thin and rapid pulse. The treatment strategy is to nourish yin and lower fire."
"Itching on the abdomen in pregnant women, pearl-like papules, photosensitivity, papules, leaf-shaped depigmentation, hemorrhagic papules, coughing up blood",Pruritic Urticarial Papules and Plaques of Pregnancy (PUPPP),Treatment for Pruritic Urticarial Papules and Plaques of Pregnancy (PUPPP) typically is not required as the condition can resolve on its own.
"Commonly occurs on exposed areas such as the face and limbs, itching, blisters have thin walls that are loose and easy to break, erosions form after rupture, and dry to form yellow crusts",Impetigo,"Treatment approaches for Impetigo include ensuring general health via skin hygiene, wearing clean clothes, frequent bathing during summer, regular hand washing, trimming fingernails, and avoiding scratching lesions to prevent widespread skin damage and isolation to stop contagion. 

1. Systemic treatment 

Generally, patients may not need oral medication; focusing on cleanliness and topical antimicrobial agents may suffice. However, for severe symptoms, extensive lesions, fever, and pyogenic infections or ineffective long-term topical treatment, sulfonamides and antibiotic preparations can be administered; severe cases should undergo pus culture and drug sensitivity testing to identify the most effective antibiotic. Newborns with Impetigo should be treated as severe infections, with options including Oxacillin, Erythromycin, Penicillin, and Co-trimoxazole. 

2. Topical treatment 

Topical therapies should aim at sterilization, anti-inflammation, pruritus relief, drying, astringency, and preventing further spread. Before medication, blisters or pustules should be punctured with a sterile needle, and fluid absorbed with a sterile cotton ball, ensuring no spillage on healthy skin. Cleanse the area with 0.1% Rifamycin, 3% Hydrogen Peroxide, 1/2000 Berberine solution, or 1/5000 Potassium Permanganate solution, removing crusts and applying the latter solution as a wet dressing for weeping erosions. Following cleaning, apply topical agents like Sulfur Precipitated Wash, 1% Gentian Violet solution, 0.5% Neomycin solution, 10% Ichthammol ointment, Bactroban ointment, Erythromycin, or Chloramphenicol ointment. Apply medication twice daily."
"Tearing, visual impairment, photophobia, itching in the eyes, dry eyes, eye pain",Pterygium,"What are the treatment methods for pterygium? Precautions before pterygium treatment? 

[Differential Treatment] 

1. Wind-heat syndrome: Presence of granules inside the eyelid, pterygium, rough and prickly sensation in the eye, scanty and watery tears, red tongue with thin yellow coating, floating and rapid pulse. The treatment focuses on dispelling wind and clearing heat.

Wind-heat toxic syndrome: Thick red filaments on the upper edge of the cornea with opacity at the tips, eye and headache, heat intolerance and light sensitivity, abundant hot tears, red tongue with yellow coating, string-like pulse. The treatment aims to clear heat and detoxify, reduce opacity, and improve vision."
"Vomiting, nausea, hematemesis, melena, upper abdominal pain",Mallory-Weiss Syndrome,"Therapeutic interventions for Mallory-Weiss Syndrome primarily consist of non-surgical management with a focus on rectifying coagulation disorders or deficiencies in coagulation factors. Non-operative treatment modalities include gastric lavage with ice saline containing norepinephrine, blood transfusions, intravenous administration of hemostatic agents and H2 Histamine receptor blockers (such as cimetidine or ranitidine), intravenous fluid resuscitations, and gastrointestinal decompression. In selected cases, control of upper gastrointestinal bleeding may be attained through the use of vasopressin. Embolization of the left gastric artery and its branches using a selective celiac artery embolization technique has also been reported, albeit with limited success in cases presenting with severe or extensive mucosal tears. Endoscopic hemostasis, either through the application of norepinephrine-soaked swabs or electrocoagulation of active bleeding sites, has proven curative in some instances. The use of a triple-lumen tube for compression hemostasis has been largely disfavored due to insufficient pressure for arterial hemorrhage control and the potential for exacerbating mucosal injuries. Surgical intervention is considered under specific circumstances including persistent or significant bleeding despite medical management, recurrent bleeding episodes, and in cases of extensive hemorrhage posing a threat to life. Preoperative preparation involves evaluating the volume of blood loss, conducting esophagogastroscopy to localize the bleeding site, and excluding esophageal varices as the bleeding source. Surgical exploration follows standard procedures with careful inspection and repair of the tear, including ligation or coagulation of visible active bleeding sites within the mucosa and submucosa, followed by continuous suturing of the tear using absorbable sutures. Postoperative management aims at preventing rebleeding, ensuring nutritional support, infection prevention, and gradual reintroduction of oral intake. Despite the reduced incidence of surgical intervention in recent years due to effective non-surgical management techniques, surgery remains crucial for cases where medical therapy fails to control the bleeding, with generally favorable outcomes and low mortality rates."
"Fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting",Campylobacter Enteritis,"Treatment options for Campylobacter enteritis include gastrointestinal isolation and thorough disinfection of the patient's feces, with isolation lasting from the onset of illness until fecal culture results are negative. For severe fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, symptomatic treatment should be given along with bed rest. Pregnant women infected with this bacteria can experience miscarriage or preterm birth, and the infection can be transmitted to newborns. Infection leads to the production of specific serum antibodies, which can enhance the phagocytic function of cells. Patients with Campylobacter enteritis often recover on their own, depending on their immune response. However, bacteria can be shed for several months, with the longest duration of shedding reaching up to one year post-recovery. Antibacterial medication can rapidly control diarrhea and stop bacterial shedding. Amikacin, Gentamicin, and Amoxicillin are among the options. Dehydration should be addressed promptly. Amikacin is mainly used for infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli resistant to Gentamicin and Kanamycin, including Escherichia coli, Proteus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For adults, administer via intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion; for urinary tract infections, 0.25g every 12 hours; for other systemic infections, 5mg/kg every 8 hours or 7.5mg/kg every 12 hours, not exceeding 1.5g per day for up to 10 days. For neonates, the initial dose is 10mg/kg, followed by 7.5mg/kg every 12 hours. The dosage for children is the same as for adults. Gentamicin is suitable for infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus (indole-positive and -negative), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter, and Staphylococci (including penicillin-G-resistant and methicillin-resistant strains), covering conditions such as neonatal sepsis, septicemia, CNS infections (including meningitis), UTI and reproductive system infections, respiratory tract infections, gastrointestinal tract infections (including peritonitis), biliary tract infections, skin, bone, otitis media, sinusitis, soft tissue infections (including burns), and listeriosis. Gentamicin can also be used intrathecally for severe CNS infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus. It is not recommended for initial treatment of simple urinary tract infections unless the pathogens are not sensitive to less toxic antibacterial drugs. Gentamicin is ineffective against most strains of Streptococci (especially group D), Pneumococci, and Anaerobes (such as Bacteroides or Clostridium). For oral administration, Gentamicin can be used for intestinal infections or as pre-operative preparation for colon surgery. Amoxicillin is suitable for infections caused by β-lactamase-negative strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus or Haemophilus influenzae, including otitis media, sinusitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis and other upper respiratory tract infections; urinary and genital tract infections caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, or Enterococcus faecalis; skin and soft tissue infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus or Escherichia coli; acute bronchitis and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus or Haemophilus influenzae; acute uncomplicated gonorrhea; and treatment of typhoid fever, typhoid carriers, and leptospirosis. Amoxicillin can also be used in combination with Clarithromycin and Lansoprazole for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori, reducing the recurrence rate of gastrointestinal ulcers."
"Cough, fever, chest tightness, fatigue, anorexia, rales, expectoration",Tropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia,"The primary treatment for Tropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia is Diethylcarbamazine, administered at a dosage of 6–8 mg/kg/day, divided into three oral doses over a period of 10–14 days. Symptoms generally improve within a few days. Alternative medications include Levamisole, Carbamyl Arsenic, and Acetyllarsan. It is often observed that the normalization of eosinophil count and radiographic changes takes longer than the disappearance of clinical symptoms, usually ranging from 1 to 3 months. Some patients may experience an exacerbation of symptoms at the beginning of the treatment, in which case a short course of Prednisone may be co-administered. Approximately 20% of cases may relapse several years after treatment. Therefore, some authors advocate for repeating the treatment 2–3 times, with each course separated by a one-month interval, to prevent relapse."
"Insomnia, headache, bruxism, nausea, abdominal distension, abdominal pain",Taeniasis,"Treatment options for Taeniasis include praziquantel, administered at a dose of 15-25mg/kg in a single dose, achieving an efficacy rate of up to 98.5%. Alternative treatments include areca nut decoction, niclosamide, or mebendazole, which should be administered continuously for 3-5 days. The prognosis for this condition is generally good."
"Papules, aberrant ichthyosis, pigmentary abnormalities, cysts, scaly plaques",Psoriasis,"The principles of treatment for psoriasis include:
The goal of psoriasis treatment is to control the condition, delay the progression towards a generalized body involvement, alleviate symptoms such as erythema, scaling, localized plaque thickening, stabilize the condition to avoid recurrence, minimize side effects, and improve the patient's quality of life. Communicating with patients and assessing their condition during the treatment process are important aspects.
In cases of moderate to severe psoriasis where monotherapy is not effective, combined, rotational or sequential therapy should be considered.
Following principles should be observed:
1. Standardized: Emphasize the use of drugs and methods recognized by the current dermatological community.
2. Safety: All treatment methods should prioritize patient safety, avoiding serious adverse reactions in pursuit of immediate therapeutic effects. Long-term application of harmful treatments without medical supervision should be avoided.
3. Individualized: The treatment plan should be comprehensively and rationally chosen considering the patient's condition, needs, tolerance, financial capability, treatment history, and drug side effects.
Systemic treatment for psoriasis:
1) Immunosuppressants such as Methotrexate (MTX), a cytotoxic drug effective for various types of psoriasis including psoriatic arthritis, erythrodermic, pustular, and generalized plaque types. Another option is Azathioprine, mainly inhibiting cellular DNA synthesis with notable side effects including myelosuppression. Hydroxyurea also shows definitive effectiveness in treating resistant psoriasis and has a lesser impact on the liver compared to its effects on white blood cells and platelets.
2) Cyclosporin A (CyA) as a new generation immunosuppressant has been increasingly used for various types of psoriasis with reported effectiveness.
Corticosteroids are not generally recommended for internal use due to serious side effects, especially on prolonged use.
Vitamin treatments such as Vitamin C injections and retinoic acids (derivatives of Vitamin A) have shown effectiveness in certain psoriasis forms but come with precautions due to potential adverse effects.
Antibiotics have seen satisfactory results in many psoriasis cases.
Immunomodulators and tar preparations also play a role in the management of psoriasis.
Topical treatments focus on keratolytic and cell growth inhibitory agents. Regular supplementation of folic acid, vitamins A, C, and B12 are beneficial.
Several physical therapies, including Balneotherapy, the use of mineral springs, and sunlight exposure, offer therapeutic benefits by improving circulation and metabolic processes.
Psychological therapy, establishing a good patient-doctor relationship, individual and group therapies are essential in managing the psychological impact of psoriasis.
Traditional Chinese Medicine approaches are diverse, focusing on the specific type of psoriasis and individual patient's condition to select the appropriate therapy."
"Visual impairment, color vision defects, nyctalopia, cataract, myopic astigmatism",Retinitis Pigmentosa,"What are the treatment methods for Retinitis Pigmentosa? Currently, there is no effective cure for this condition. Various therapies have been explored in the literature, including the use of vasodilators, vitamins A, E, and B12, tissue therapy, transplantation of bovine pituitary, pituitary radiation, various hormones, traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, and extraocular muscle choroidal interstitial transplantation surgery, yet their efficacy is uncertain. Some treatments may not only be ineffective but also harmful. Clinical observations also vary due to the high heterogeneity of genetic factors, patients' living conditions, and mental state, hence individual reports should be taken as reference only. To possibly prevent rapid deterioration of visual function, the following measures can be advised: 1. The use of sunglasses. Bright light can accelerate the degeneration of the photoreceptor outer segments, so it is essential to wear sunglasses. Theoretically, the color of the sunglasses should match the color of vision red, namely purplish-red, but gray is often chosen for cosmetic reasons, and photochromic gray lenses can also be an option. Deep black sunglasses are not suitable, and green lenses are strictly prohibited. 2. Avoiding excessive mental and physical stress. Excessive stress increases catecholamines in body fluids, causing the choroidal blood vessels to contract and resulting in a hypoxic state that may accelerate the degeneration of photoreceptors. Traditional Chinese Qigong therapy (static exercises), through persistent practice, can regulate the activity of the cerebral cortex and various organs according to one's will and might help in preventing the rapid progression of this disease towards deterioration. Prognosis: Patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa generally have an earlier onset, severe conditions, and rapid progression, leading to a very poor prognosis. By the age of about 30, visual function can be severely impaired, progressing to near-total blindness by the age of 50. There is no significant difference in the age of onset between patients with autosomal recessive and dominant inheritance, but visual function in autosomal dominant cases tends to be less severely affected than in recessive cases. Occasionally, some patients may experience a halt in progression, thus having a relatively better prognosis compared to those with X-linked and recessive inheritance."
"Headache, somnolence, dizziness, and fatigue",Polycythemia Vera,"Treatment options for Polycythemia Vera include: 
    - The primary approach involves treating the underlying condition. Secondary polycythemia should resolve once the primary condition is treated. 
    - Elimination of factors that could cause or exacerbate increased red blood cell production. 
    - Phlebotomy might be required in necessary cases. 
Special treatments 
    1. Pharmacotherapy is necessary and must be tailored to the individual's age and physical condition, with adherence to prescribed medication. This can be supplemented with Antelope powder and Oyster shell. 
        (1) Antelope powder, taken daily at 0.5 grams, helps eliminate viruses from the body and purifies the blood. 
        (2) Oyster shell is consumed daily as a 30-gram infusion in boiling water, similar to drinking tea. Oyster shell's properties are salty and slightly cold, which can consolidate yin, submerge yang, stop sweating, and soften and disperse hard lumps. Modern pharmacological studies have indicated that Oyster shell has anti-cancerous effects."
"Impaired speech, limb spasticity, difficulty in flexion and extension, and facial asymmetry",Post-stroke Sequelae,"The treatment options for post-stroke sequelae often involve a challenging prognosis, with integrated rehabilitation therapy recognized as the currently optimal approach. The principal effective rehabilitation measures we adopt include: 
1. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Rehabilitation: For hemiplegia during the flaccid phase, formulas like modified Bu Yang Huan Wu Tang, which augments qi, activates blood circulation, and unblocks channels, are often used. In the spastic phase, modification of Si Wu Tang combined with Tian Ma Gou Teng Yin, known for nourishing blood, pacifying liver, extinguishing wind, and activating channels, is more common. For speech impairment, Jie Yu Dan modified to dispel wind and phlegm is used frequently. In cases of kidney deficiency, Zuo Gui Yin is added. For patients with dementia, a combination of He Che Da Zao Wan and An Nao Wan, which benefits the spleen and kidney, nourishes the brain and marrow, transforms stasis, and clears phlegm to open the orifices, is common. Key to superior therapeutic outcomes compared to traditional medications are the novel breakthroughs in the selection and dosage of each herb. 
2. Acupuncture Rehabilitation: Beyond standard acupoint selection, we employ acupuncture on certain special-effect points to improve outcomes, such as 'Yin Bai' for lower limb flaccidity and 'Zhong Ping Fu' for shoulder joint immobility. Techniques ensure each needle insertion elicits sensations of soreness, pain, distension, or directional flow. In cases like flaccid paralysis, stimulation of 'Yin Xue' to produce leg twitching and lifting actions can yield rapid and noticeable results. Combining this with the Ling Gui Ba Fa timed acupoint selection method often results in remarkably effective outcomes. Through these unique acupoint prescriptions and acupuncture techniques, we have elevated the restoration of limb function, enabling patients previously deemed incapable of standing, to navigate stairs and exit or enter their homes. 
3. Scientific Exercise Function Training: Encompasses passive, active, and resistance movements, as well as rehabilitation therapies. Adopting these advanced rehabilitation medical exercise training methods under the guidance of rehabilitation therapists, tailored to individual conditions, represents the advent of innovative technologies within rehabilitation medicine that remain scarcely mastered even among premier hospitals. 
4. Other rehabilitation methods, including the use of 'Stroke Treatment Instruments', integration of massage therapy during the passive movement phase, Qi Gong guided rehabilitation, and others, have shown effectiveness. Emphasizing psychological therapy to foster a positive mindset in patients, encouraging active participation in physical movement rehabilitation training, is equally crucial for the restoration of disabled functions. This also extends to 'Rehabilitation Nursing' to support the completion of rehabilitation plans and prevent secondary disabilities."
"Rhinophyma, Papulopustular Acne, Pigmented Dermatosis",Demodicosis,"What are the treatment options for Demodicosis?
    1. Western medicine focuses on eliminating mites, reducing sebum, and alleviating symptoms as treatment principles, such as taking oral metronidazole. However, recurrence is common.
    2. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) often uses methods like clearing the lung and stomach, cooling blood to detoxify, and promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis for treatment.
    3. Oral administration of tinidazole 0.1g, three times a day, or metronidazole 0.2g, three times a day, for a two-week course of treatment, along with the use of 5% sulfur washes, or benzoyl peroxide emulsion."
Diffuse pigmentation on exposed parts of the body such as the face,Melasma,"What are the treatment methods for Melasma?
    First, it's essential to carefully identify the cause and avoid contact with compounds such as tar. Workers exposed to asphalt and tar should be attentive to labor protection and avoid working under intense sunlight. If cosmetically induced photosensitive dermatitis occurs after the application of cosmetics, their use should be discontinued immediately. A photopatch test with the suspected allergen may be necessary. If the cause of the condition can be identified, avoiding contact will gradually lighten the skin color until it returns to normal.
    There are no effective medications for the treatment of Melasma. However, patients can take oral compound vitamin B or intravenous injections of vitamin C. Topical use of 3% hydroquinone cream is also advised.
    - General principle: Avoid sun exposure and use sunscreen when going out.
    - Systemic treatment: Oral administration of high-dose vitamin C, 1.0g each time, three times a day. Or intravenous infusion of vitamin C, 3~5g daily for 15 treatments per course.
    - Local treatment: 3% hydroquinone cream, applied 2-3 times a day.
    - Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment: Liangfu pills (400 pills/bottle) 20 pills each time, three times a day, taken with warm water on an empty stomach, 12 weeks per treatment course, effectively eliminating facial pigment spots."
"Facial port-wine stains, epileptic seizures, intellectual disability, attention deficit, memory loss, speech disorders, behavioral changes, cognitive impairment",Sturge-Weber Syndrome,Treatment options for Sturge-Weber Syndrome include seizure management with antiepileptic drugs. Facial port-wine stains may be addressed with cosmetic surgery or laser therapy. Surgical options are available for glaucoma and proptosis. Selected patients might benefit from lobectomy or hemispherectomy. Rehabilitation is recommended for individuals with hemiparesis.
"Prolonged fever, excessive sweating, joint pain, hepatosplenomegaly, cough with white frothy sputum, and hematochezia",Brucellosis,"What are the treatment methods for Brucellosis?

Western Medicine Treatment:
1. For the acute, subacute, and the acute phase of the chronic stage, antimicrobial therapy is the primary approach.
  a. General treatment: Bed rest, provision of a nutrition-rich diet, and sufficient fluids; intravenous fluid supplementation and antipyretic analgesics for patients with high fever.
  b. Antimicrobial therapy: To enhance therapeutic effects, prevent drug resistance, and reduce recurrences, combination therapy is often adopted.
    i. Streptomycin and tetracycline combination: Streptomycin 0.5g, administered intramuscularly twice a day; tetracycline 0.5g, four times a day. The treatment course usually lasts no less than 3 weeks, with a break of 5–7 days, and 2–3 courses are suitable.
    ii. Streptomycin and rifampicin combination: Streptomycin 0.5g, administered intramuscularly twice a day for 2–3 weeks; rifampicin 0.2g per day for 6 weeks. Some foreign scholars consider this as a better medication regimen.
    iii. Kanamycin or gentamicin combined with tetracycline: Kanamycin 1.5g per day or gentamicin 240,000 units, diluted and administered intravenously; tetracycline 0.5g, four times a day, for a 3-week course.
    iv. Rifampin and doxycycline combination: Rifampin 0.6–0.9g per day, doxycycline 0.2g, taken in one dose, for a 6-week course, with 2 courses recommended. Rifampin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that easily penetrates cell walls, offering better therapeutic effects and lower relapse rates.
    v. Compound sulfamethoxazole: 2 pills each time, three times a day, for a 6-week course.
  c. Corticosteroids: Used for severe cases, such as serious septicemia, significant testicular swelling, serious cardiac or cerebral diseases, or pancytopenia, commonly using prednisolone 200–300mg/day, or dexamethasone 10–20mg/day, diluted and administered intravenously, for a 3–5 day course, or adjusted according to symptom improvement and gradually discontinued.
2. The chronic phase should adopt a comprehensive treatment primarily based on antimicrobial therapy and specific desensitization therapy.
  a. Specific desensitization therapy: Suitable for chronic arthritis and migratory lesions. Desensitization therapy with bacterial vaccines, hydrolases, and lysates are appropriate.
  b. Antimicrobial treatment: Streptomycin combined with tetracycline is generally considered effective, but the tetracycline course should be extended to more than 6 weeks and streptomycin is suitable for 4 weeks.
  c. Surgical treatment: Applicable for bacterial synovitis, arthritis, osteomyelitis, etc. Purulent lesions can be surgically drained. Osteomyelitis should be thoroughly debrided, supplemented with long-term antimicrobial therapy. Besides tetracycline and streptomycin, chloramphenicol and gentamicin combination therapy can also be considered. Spinal infections or intervertebral disc infections generally do not require surgical drainage.
3. Treatment of complications
  a. Brucella meningitis: During treatment, consideration should be given to whether the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier. Chloramphenicol combined with streptomycin is more effective. Chloramphenicol 2–3g per day administered intravenously, for a 2–3 week course.
  b. Brucella endocarditis: Chloramphenicol, streptomycin, tetracycline, and sulfonamides can be combined, requiring a longer course. Rifampin combined with streptomycin can also be used. Besides the disappearance of clinical symptoms, embolic phenomena, and multiple negative blood cultures, a significant decrease in IgG antibody titers often suggests complete eradication of the pathogen.

Combined Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Treatment:
The treatment effectiveness is generally good during the acute phase with antibiotic therapy; antibiotics should be started early, in adequate amounts and throughout the entire course. Based on the location of the toxins and the condition of deficiency or excess, treatments clearing heat and dampness, detoxifying and cooling blood decoction can expedite symptom relief, shorten the disease course, and reduce recurrences. There's no ideal method in Western medicine for the chronic phase, but Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has certain advantages. In addition to antimicrobial and desensitization therapies, Chinese herbal medicines with immunomodulatory functions, enhancing macrophage phagocytosis, and inhibiting allergic reactions with desensitization effects can be selected. Treatment duration should be longer, courses sufficient, and dosages appropriately increased. Non-pharmacological treatments can be opted for joint lesions."
"Seizures, port-wine stains, hemiparesis, hemiatrophy, glaucoma, and proptosis with vision impairment.",Sturge-Weber Syndrome,"Treatment modalities for Sturge-Weber Syndrome include: 
Topical Medications: The use of miquimod and timolol has become more prevalent, with miquimod showing superior efficacy to timolol, which can have some cardiac side effects. These medications, initially not intended for treating hemangiomas, have been found to be effective in recent years and are increasingly used due to their minimal side effects, non-invasiveness, and less scarring compared to other treatments. However, their effectiveness is not as reliable, benefiting only about 70% of patients. 
Laser Therapy: Originating in the 1990s, laser therapy employs high-energy, precisely focused monochromatic light with some penetration capability. Unlike radiation therapy, laser is a form of light, not radioactive. Not all medical lasers are suitable for treating hemangiomas, but a few are specifically designed for this purpose. The treatment principle involves the selective absorption of specific wavelengths of light by oxyhemoglobin, causing instantaneous coagulation of hemoglobin within the vessel, leading to closure and subsequent regression of the hemangioma. Initial treatments utilized VP, photodynamic and E-light lasers, with LP laser being a more recent addition."
"Persistent fever, strawberry tongue, rash, hard edema of the palms, abdominal pain, diarrhea, perianal skin erythema",Kawasaki Disease,"What are the treatment methods for Kawasaki disease?
     Acute phase treatment
        1. Immunoglobulin: Recent studies have confirmed that early intravenous administration of immunoglobulin combined with oral aspirin treatment can reduce the incidence rate of coronary artery aneurysms in Kawasaki disease. It must be stressed that medications should be used within 10 days after onset. The dosage is 400mg/kg of immunoglobulin IV infusion daily, over 2-4 hours, for 4 consecutive days; simultaneously, oral aspirin is administered at 50-100 mg/kg·d divided into 3-4 doses for 4 consecutive days, then reduced to 5mg/kg·d in a single dose.
        2. Aspirin: Early-stage oral administration of aspirin can control the acute inflammatory process and reduce coronary artery lesions. However, there is no control study indicating that aspirin treatment can reduce the incidence of coronary artery aneurysms. The dosing regimen is 30-100 mg·kg per day, divided into 3-4 doses. Japanese doctors prefer to use a smaller dosage based on the belief that acute patients have reduced absorption and increased clearance of aspirin, and a larger dose is needed to achieve an anti-inflammatory effect. Patients are given the drug for 14 days, and after the fever subsides, the dose is reduced to 3-5 mg/kg per day in a single dose, continuing to its antiplatelet aggregation effect.
        3. Corticosteroids: Corticosteroids are known for their strong anti-inflammatory effects which can alleviate symptoms. However, it was later found that corticosteroids can lead to thrombosis, hinder the repair of coronary artery lesions and promote the formation of aneurysms, hence their use as a sole treatment method with high-dose prednisone is not recommended. It may be used in combination with aspirin in cases of severe myocarditis or persistent high fever, to control the early inflammatory response of Kawasaki disease. Generally, corticosteroids are not used as a single treatment option.
     Recovery phase and subsequent treatment
        1. Anticoagulation therapy: In the recovery phase, patients are given aspirin at 3-5mg/kg per day in a single dose until erythrocyte sedimentation rate and platelets return to normal. If there are no coronary artery abnormalities, medication is generally discontinued 6-8 weeks after disease onset. Subsequently, ultrasound echocardiograms are recommended every 6 months or 1 year. For patients with chronic-phase coronary artery involvement, long-term anticoagulation medication is necessary, and close follow-up is required. For patients with small solitary coronary artery aneurysms, long-term aspirin therapy at 3-5mg/kg·d is required until the aneurysm regresses. For those who are aspirin intolerant, dipyridamole can be used at 3-6mg/kg per day in 2-3 divided doses. Cardiac condition, including echocardiogram, clinical data or exercise test suggestive of myocardial ischemia, should be assessed annually. If coronary artery angiography is indicated by symptoms of myocardial ischemia or positive exercise test, major or multiple coronary artery aneurysms, or severe artery stenosis or occlusion, long-term oral aspirin and dipyridamole should be administered. Patients with giant aneurysms, prone to thrombosis and coronary artery stenosis or occlusion, may be treated with oral anticoagulants such as Warfarin. Physical activity should be restricted and sports participation avoided. Cardiac conditions should be assessed every 3-6 months, and if there are signs of myocardial ischemia or a positive exercise test, coronary artery angiography should be performed to understand the progression of stenotic lesions. Patients with occlusion of one or more main coronary arteries should undergo long-term anticoagulant treatment and repeat cardiac assessments, including myocardial scanning, exercise test, coronary angiography, and consider surgical intervention.
        2. Thrombolysis: In patients with myocardial infarction and thrombosis, intravenous or percutaneous coronary artery catheter administration of medication promotes coronary reperfusion and myocardial reperfusion. Intravenous thrombolysis within one hour with 20000u/kg of urokinase, followed by 3000-4000u/kg per hour. Coronary artery medication within an hour with 1000u/kg of urokinase. Streptokinase can also be used, with intravenous thrombolysis within an hour at 10000u/kg, and it may be administered again after half an hour. These medications rapidly dissolve fibrin with good effects and no adverse reactions.
        3. Coronary angioplasty (PTCA): Successful dilatation has been achieved in recent years using balloon catheters for patients with coronary artery stenosis.
        4. Surgical treatment: Indications for coronary artery bypass surgery include: high-degree blockage of the left main trunk, multiple high-degree blockages, and near-high-degree blockage of the left anterior descending branch. For severe cases of mitral valve insufficiency where medical treatment is ineffective, valvuloplasty or valve replacement surgery can be performed. In Japan, 62 Kawasaki disease patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery also included 7 cases undergoing mitral valve surgery. Preoperatively, 70% of patients had symptoms of angina, heart failure, or other symptoms. The 4-year survival rate after surgery was 87%, and the 10-year survival rate was 45%, with most deaths occurring due to late myocardial infarction or sudden death.
        Cardiogenic shock, heart failure, and arrhythmias should be treated accordingly.

     Antibiotic therapy alone is ineffective for this disease. As with other fever-inducing illnesses, patients should be encouraged to consume plenty of fluids, preferably juice. There is no specific guideline for when patients can return to normal activities such as school or work, as long as they do not experience significant discomfort. Generally, Kawasaki disease does not recur, but due to the cardiac complications that can arise years later, regular cardiac examinations are necessary.
     Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatments for Kawasaki disease
     General rehabilitation therapy: Patients need to ensure adequate hydration and caloric intake, maintaining a light diet, eating easily digestible foods, and enhancing personal care.
     TCM differentiation and treatment:
        1. For sudden onset, persistent high fever, not shivering, or slightly aversive to wind, thirst with a preference for cold drinks, no sweat, cough, red eyes, and throat, palm and sole erythema, initial appearance of rash on the face and trunk, swollen neck lymph nodes, poor appetite, red tongue, thin white coating, floating and rapid pulse, treatment should focus on expelling wind, clearing heat, discharging toxins. [Prescription] Modified Yin Qiao San: Honeysuckle, Forsythia suspensa each 12g, mint 7g, Burdock seeds, Scrophularia ningpoensis, Indigo naturalis, Reed root each 12g, raw Licorice 7g.

During this phase, Qing Ying Tang, Hua Ban Tang, Xi Jiao Di Huang Tang, etc., can also be selected.
        3. For lingering low fever, dry throat and mouth, cracked and dry lips, peeling fingertips or flaking, poor appetite, red tongue with little saliva, fine and rapid pulse, treatment should focus on clearing residual heat, nourishing yin, and generating fluids. [Prescription] Modified Zhu Ye Shi Gao Tang: Raw gypsum 12g, bamboo leaves 7g, roasted Gardenia jasminoides, Radix adenophorae, Dwarf lilyturf root, Dendrobium nobile, Trichosanthes root, fresh Reed root each 12g, raw Licorice 7g; or use modified Mai Men Dong Tang.
        4. For cases where the fever has subsided but there is fatigue, weakness, easy sweating upon exertion, thirst with a preference for cold drinks, or palpitations, red tongue with little saliva, thin white coating, weak or irregular pulse, treatment should focus on boosting qi and nourishing yin. [Prescription] Modified Sheng Mai San: Prince ginseng (or Codonopsis), Schisandra chinensis, Dwarf lilyturf root, raw Astragalus, stir-fried Atractylodes macrocephala, raw Chinese yam, Dendrobium, fresh sprouted rice each 6-12g.

"Low-grade fever, dry cough, chest discomfort, hemoptysis",Simple Pulmonary Eosinophilia,"The treatment for Simple Pulmonary Eosinophilia primarily involves observation due to the mild nature of its symptoms, which include transient migratory shadows on chest X-rays, elevated eosinophils in the blood, and the potential for self-resolution of the condition over a short course. In cases caused by Ascaris infection, eggs can be detected in the feces 2 to 3 months after symptom onset, typically not requiring treatment. Immediate discontinuation of the causative medication is advised for suspected drug-induced cases. Anthelmintic treatment is recommended for parasite-induced conditions. Corticosteroids may be used in cases with significant symptoms or recurrent episodes. Generally, the prognosis for eosinophilic pneumonia is fairly good."
"Headache, rash, insomnia, coma, nausea and vomiting, constipation, high fever, fever with chills, dizziness, fatigue, chills, and irregular fever",Scrub Typhus,"The treatment for Scrub Typhus includes: 1. Standard nursing care according to infectious disease protocols. 2. Adequate hydration, electrolyte, and vitamin replenishment. 3. Physical methods are primarily used for high fever reduction, with the administration of antipyretic analgesics in small doses if necessary. Corticosteroids may be administered in cases of severe septicemic symptoms, with treatments for hypovolemic shock or septic shock applied as appropriate in cases showing tendencies toward low blood volume or shock. 4. Doxycycline, Minocycline, and Chloramphenicol are effective against this disease."
"Swelling and pain at the injury site, limb weakness and numbness, sensory disturbances in limbs below the level of injury",Spinal Cord Injury,"Treatment approaches for spinal cord injuries include: 

Immediate care and transportation should not utilize a soft stretcher; a rigid board is preferred. The patient's legs and arms should be kept straight, positioned alongside the body. The board is placed next to the patient, and 2-3 people should assist by rolling the patient's torso, pelvis, and limbs as a single unit onto the board. Techniques such as carrying by lofting or having one person lift the head and another lift the legs are prohibited. For cervical spine injuries, the head should be supported and slightly tractioned in line with the body during the roll. The patient's body should be cushioned and secured to the board, with continuous monitoring of airway obstructions, breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure during movement. 

1. Simple spinal fractures: 
- For light compression fractures of the thoracolumbar section, and stable types: the patient may lie flat on a rigid bed with the lower back elevated; back extensor muscles can be exercised a few days later, with the patient being mobilized after 3-4 weeks. 
- Severe compression exceeding 50% in the thoracolumbar section should be treated with closed reduction, followed by stabilization with a plaster cast brace for three months. 
- Cervical fractures or dislocations with light compression and displacement can be treated with jaw-strap traction for realignment, followed by a head-chest plaster cast for three months. Severe compression and displacement may require continuous cranial traction, with X-ray reviews post-realignment, and a head-chest plaster for three months. Failed traction realignment necessitates surgical open reduction and internal fixation. 
- Thoracolumbar fractures of an unstable type: Compression exceeding half of the vertebrae, deformity angles greater than 20 degrees, or associated dislocation might require surgical open reduction and internal fixation. 

2. Spinal fractures with spinal cord injury: 
Surgical treatment, including open reduction and internal fixation or decompression surgery, forms a crucial part of comprehensive rehabilitation. 

Comprehensive treatment includes: 
- Dehydration therapy to reduce spinal cord edema. 
- Steroid therapy to alleviate traumatic inflammation of the spinal cord. 
- The use of antioxidants like vitamins E, A, C, and coenzyme Q, calcium channel blockers, and lidocaine is believed to mitigate secondary damage post-injury. 

Prevention and management of complications involve: 
- Prevention of pressure sores. 
- Prevention of urinary system infections. 
- Management of joint stiffness and deformities. 
- Prevention and treatment of respiratory infections. 
- Symptomatic treatment."
"Typically presents as solitary, irregularly shaped white plaques with loss of elasticity and shine. These plaques can enlarge and merge together, often accompanied by itching and pain.",Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus,"What are the treatment options for vulvar lichen sclerosus? 
1. Conventional medication treatment (topical ointments, corticosteroids, traditional Chinese medicine): Medication is a common approach for patients with mild conditions, offering short-term efficacy. However, it addresses symptoms without tackling the underlying causes, leading to relapses upon discontinuation and dependence on medication, making it challenging to achieve a comprehensive cure. 
2. Surgical excision: Surgical removal can temporarily halt the progression to vulvar cancer. However, studies have shown the recurrence rate post-surgery is over 80%, and the procedure significantly impacts sexual function, making this method not commonly recommended presently. 
3. Oral medication treatment: Vulvar lichen sclerosus often results from nutritional disturbances around the vulva, leading to malnutrition. Therefore, the effectiveness of oral medications is somewhat limited as the drugs must navigate through the digestive system to reach the affected area, facing degradation by digestive fluids and barriers, significantly reducing their efficacy. Furthermore, long-term oral medication can aggravate gastrointestinal irritation without curing the condition, hence not recommended. 
4. Physical therapy (cryotherapy, electrocautery, laser therapy): Cryotherapy involves using liquid nitrogen or oxygen locally to destroy the affected tissue. Though short-term results are promising, the recurrence rate is relatively high, and patients may experience shock from cold hypersensitivity. Electrocautery has been used in treating vulvar lichen sclerosus but is limited by the small number of treated cases and high demand for post-operative infection control."
"Absence of breast engorgement, pale complexion, spontaneous milk flow",Galactorrhea,"What are the treatment methods for Galactorrhea? 
 Precautions before treating Galactorrhea include avoiding psychological stress and reducing or avoiding the use of drugs that increase prolactin levels. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) approaches to treating Galactorrhea, despite its distinct name, share a common root cause with spontaneous milk flow; it is often caused by qi deficiency that fails to contain. For instance, patients with a constitution of qi and blood deficiency, after pregnancy, qi and blood gather to nourish the fetus, hence showing deficiency. The breast belongs to the Stomach Meridian of Foot Yangming, and breast milk is transformed from qi and blood, which originate from the spleen and stomach. Qi deficiency leads to a lack of control, and the nutritive yin cannot be kept internally, resulting in spontaneous milk overflow; spleen and stomach weakness result in insufficient transformation source, leading to blood deficiency and thus, diluted milk. Qi and blood deficiency does not nourish the face, leading to a pale complexion; blood deficiency may cause dizziness and dark vision in front of the eyes; qi deficiency may lead to shortness of breath, reluctance to speak, low voice, and mental fatigue; a pale tongue and a weak pulse are indicators of qi and blood deficiency. Treatment often involves the use of Astragalus, Angelica, White Peony, Prepared Rehmannia, and Schisandra to supplement the middle qi, nourish the blood, and secure containment."
"Low-grade fever, anorexia, weight loss, cough, pleural effusion",Pneumocystis Pneumonia,"The treatment modalities for Pneumocystis Pneumonia include: 
1. Immediate treatment with Amphotericin B (AMB) is recommended for patients with extensive pulmonary lesions, acute pneumonitis, and severe hypoxemia. However, the necessity of treatment for all cases of acute pneumonitis due to Pneumocystis is still under debate, as many patients with mild to moderate symptoms may recover spontaneously without treatment. With the advent of safe, effective, and less toxic oral antifungal drug Itraconazole for clinical use, it is now advocated that antifungal treatment should be withheld in patients who present with acute pneumonia, relatively mild initial symptoms, and show significant improvement upon diagnosis. 
Itraconazole has shown good efficacy in treating most cases of Pneumocystis pneumonia, including acute, subacute, chronic, and non-meningeal disseminated infections. The treatment duration is 6 months, though sometimes a longer course may be required. Ketoconazole is less effective and more toxic than Itraconazole, but it is cheaper. Fluconazole may also be less effective than Itraconazole and is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate or absorb Itraconazole. Furthermore, Fluconazole has a strong ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, thus high-dose Fluconazole may be more effective for central nervous system pneumocystis infections. 
AMB is reserved for a few severe cases, including diffuse pulmonary infiltration, severe systemic toxicity, severe gas exchange abnormalities, and rapidly disseminating infections. For severe infections, a sequential treatment approach is recommended. Begin with AMB to achieve clinical improvement, followed by 6 months of Itraconazole treatment. 
2. The prognoses for AIDS patients are not optimistic. Similar to histoplasmosis, even if patients respond well to the initial induction treatment, permanent cure is not achievable. Severe cases may die early. 
A sequential treatment regimen can be used. Start with AMB for induction treatment till clinical control is achieved, and then maintain with Itraconazole for life. Some patients with less severe immunosuppression can start treatment with Itraconazole from the onset of the disease. 
3. Other immunosuppressed patients, including those on corticosteroid therapy and organ transplant recipients, who are less severely immunosuppressed may achieve ultimate cure. The treatment regimen typically involves a total dose of 2.0g AMB and at least 12 months of Itraconazole, or AMB until clinical improvement followed by Itraconazole for 6-12 months. Nephrotoxicity of AMB is a particular concern for transplant recipients on cyclosporine therapy. The new liposomal AMB has significantly reduced nephrotoxicity, with comparable efficacy to conventional AMB but at a higher cost. Itraconazole used as initial treatment can avoid nephrotoxicity, but it may be less effective for severe cases and has a higher relapse rate after treatment completion. Moreover, Itraconazole interacts with many drugs, and concurrent use with cyclosporine can increase blood levels of cyclosporine. Fluconazole has relatively fewer drug interactions."
"Uneven muscle fibers, spontaneous fractures, joint swelling, vaginal bleeding, precocious puberty",Fibrous Dysplasia,"Treatment options for Fibrous Dysplasia include the following:
1. Non-surgical treatment: Research, especially from abroad, indicates bisphosphonates as a primary non-surgical treatment. These compounds work by inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, though their exact mechanism is not well-understood. Pamidronate, a second-generation bisphosphonate, is clinically used to significantly reduce pain and slow osteolytic changes as indicated by plasma alkaline phosphatase activity and urinary hydroxyproline content. This results in increased bone density in imaging studies, though original bone lesions do not heal completely. Transient exacerbation has been reported in a small number of pediatric patients. Further observation is required to conclusively determine efficacy.
2. Surgical treatment involves various approaches based on clinical, radiographic, and pathological findings, especially in long bones with solitary lesions. Techniques include curettage and bone grafting, suitable for localized lesions with minimal bone destruction. The procedure involves removing the diseased tissue through an opening, followed by bone grafting. Other methods include osteotomy, curettage, and corrective bone grafting for extensive lesions with coxa vara of the proximal femur; segmental resection for severely destroyed long bones; partial resection, curettage, and bone grafting for lesions affecting the diaphysis and metaphyseal regions, potentially sparing the joint; and extensive surgical removal and rib grafting for full-length or multifocal fibrous dysplasia in long bones. Multifocal lesions generally are not amenable to surgery, except symptomatic areas primarily treated for deformities and fractures. Recurrence is possible postoperatively, with single lesions being less frequent and multifocal more common. Pathological fractures may be treated generally as regular fractures with immobilization or external fixation, most healing well, followed by lesion removal and bone grafting, or simultaneous lesion clearance, fracture fixation, deformity correction, and bone grafting.
Recent research suggests fibrous dysplasia is a tumor-like lesion caused by genetic mutations leading to abnormal proliferation and differentiation of fibro-osseous cells, proposing it be classified as a non-cystic benign bone tumor. The prognosis is generally favorable, though deformities are common, and a small percentage may undergo malignant transformation. Radiation therapy significantly increases the risk of cancer. No specific treatment exists for skin pigmentation and precocious puberty due to this condition. With deeper understanding, new treatment protocols including gene therapy targeting the cause may emerge as a potential breakthrough in managing this condition.
The overall prognosis is good, with a malignancy rate of approximately 2% to 3%."
"Chills, fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, acute onset, localized redness and swelling with well-defined edges, accompanied by high fever and pain",Erysipelas,"Treatment options for Erysipelas include: 
1. Systemic Therapy: Penicillin is the first choice, with a course of treatment lasting 10-14 days. For those allergic to penicillin, macrolide antibiotics can be used as an alternative. Patients with recurrent erysipelas may benefit from high-dose antibiotic therapy during active lymphangitis, but to achieve complete efficacy, treatment should continue with intermittent low doses for an extended period. 

2. Local Treatment: Various antimicrobial agents can be applied topically to the affected skin. Compression therapy can help reduce lymphedema and prevent recurrence. This can be supplemented with physical therapies, such as narrowband ultraviolet light exposure. 

3. Surgical Treatment: For persistent hard edema unresponsive to the above treatments, plastic surgery may be recommended."
"Nail deformity, thickening, appearing white or gray",Onychomycosis,"What are the treatment methods for onychomycosis? The treatment of onychomycosis should adopt a comprehensive and sustained approach, not only targeting the infected nails but also treating tinea pedis and tinea manuum concurrently, maintaining long-term treatment. Candida paronychia should take occupational factors into account to avoid moist environments as well as prevent nail trauma. 
 
1. Topical treatment is suitable for cases with a small number of affected nails. Persist in applying 5% amorolfine nail lacquer, 8% ciclopirox olamine (ciclopirox ethanolamine) nail lacquer, 30% acetic acid, iodine-lactic solution (10% iodine mixed with 50% lactic acid) or compound salicylic acid ointment. Soak feet in warm water before applying medication and gently scrape off the infected nails with a small knife or file. Generally, treatment should be continued for 6 to 12 months. 40% urea ointment can also be used to soften the nails before scraping them off, followed by the application of antifungal medications. Surgical removal of the affected nails, followed by the application of antifungal drugs, is also an option. 
 
2. Systemic treatment is suitable for multiple affected nails or when topical treatment is ineffective. The treatment duration should be adjusted based on the patient's age, condition of the infected nails, and nail growth rate, among other factors. 
 
   (1) Terbinafine: Effective against dermatophytes and fungal infections. Low efficacy for yeast infection of the nails. Oral administration of 250mg/day, with nail fungus requiring 6 weeks, and toe fungus requiring 12 weeks. Or use an alternate-day therapy, starting with 250mg/day in the first week, then alternate days from the second week, 250mg each time, nail fungus requires 3 months, toe fungus requires 6 months. 
 
   (2) Itraconazole: Effective against dermatophytes, yeast, and fungal infections. Currently, a short-course intermittent pulse therapy is commonly used, with oral administration of 200mg twice a day for 7 consecutive days as one course. Nail fungus may require 2 to 3 courses, toe fungus 3 to 4 courses. 
 
   (3) Fluconazole: Effective against dermatophytes, yeast, and fungal infections. Oral administration once a week, 150mg each time. Nail fungus requires 3 to 4 months, toe fungus more than 6 months. 
 
3. Traditional Chinese medicine nail removal involves applying a purple plaster stick, heated to soften, then adhered to the affected nail for 7 to 10 days before removal, using a blunt knife to scrape off the softened keratin, and then reapplying. This method is repeated until a new nail grows. Alternatively, the infected nail can be soaked in medicinal vinegar for about 20 to 30 minutes (without washing off the vinegar afterward). This method is simpler than nail removal."
"Breast pain, breast swelling, nipple fissure, nipple discharge",Mastitis,"What are the treatments for mastitis? Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatments include: 
1. Fresh cactus (peeled and thorns removed) is mashed and applied to the affected area once a day, for a course of 3 days. 
2. Fresh dandelions and chrysanthemum leaves are pounded into juice and applied externally once a day, for 3 days per course. 
3. Fresh scallions (150g) are boiled in water. The affected breast is then fumigated and washed with the solution 3-5 times a day, with 2 days making one course of treatment. 
4. Glauber's salt is dissolved in boiling water at a 1:5 ratio, applied to the affected area with thick gauze for 20-30 minutes, 3 times a day, for 3 days per course. 
5. Liu Shen Wan is ground into a fine powder and mixed with an appropriate amount of Vaseline to form a paste, which is then applied to the affected area and changed once a day, for a course of 3 days. 
6. Galla Chinensis is ground into a fine powder, mixed with edible vinegar, and applied to the affected area, changed every 2 days, for a 10-day course. 

Mastitis is most prevalent among breastfeeding women. The use of oral medications can affect breastfeeding infants. Untreated mastitis can significantly disrupt the lives of breastfeeding women. Generally, external TCM treatments are recommended as most TCM remedies are plant-derived and externally applied, posing no internal impact on the patient's body, thus ensuring the child's feeding is unaffected. 

Internal disease external treatment in TCM is currently the best method for treating mastitis. This approach combines cleanliness, rest, cessation of breastfeeding in the affected breast, medicinal herbs for external application, antibiotics for severe infections, hot compresses, local anesthetic blockades to reduce inflammation, surgical drainage if abscesses form, and a combination of massage therapy and TCM external applications for comprehensive treatment. For high temperatures above 38.5°C and significant systemic reactions, antibiotics may be used along with TCM practices for effective outcomes."
"Snoring during sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness, loud and irregular snoring sounds",Sleep Apnea Syndrome,"There are several therapy approaches for Sleep Apnea Syndrome (SAS): 
1. Etiological treatment: Hypothyroidism can be a confirmed cause of SAS, and thyroid hormone replacement therapy may alleviate or eliminate SAS. Half of patients with heart failure may present with SAS, primarily central sleep apnea (CSA), which can improve after pharmacologic treatment for heart function. 
2. Oxygen therapy: For most SAS patients, oxygen therapy is not necessary; for those indicated for oxygen therapy, it should be combined with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation to avoid CO2 retention and sleep disturbance caused by prolonged apnea due to oxygen therapy alone. 
3. General measures: Advising patients to adopt good sleep habits to obtain enough sleep duration and optimal sleep quality. Weight loss, smoking cessation, avoiding alcohol, exercising caution with sedative hypnotics, side sleeping positions, and using nasal decongestants to maintain nasal patency can be effective for mild cases and those with simple snoring. 
4. Pharmacological treatment: Methylxanthines (such as theophylline) and acetazolamide have been used to treat CSAS due to their respiratory stimulant effects, but are rarely used currently due to poor efficacy and significant side effects. 
5. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy: The principal theory in using CPAP to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) involves increasing the positive pressure within the pharynx to oppose inspiratory negative pressure and prevent airway collapse. It has been effective since its inception in 1981 for both OSAS and CSAS and is now the first-line treatment approach. Newer models like Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) machines and auto-adjusting CPAP machines have been applied clinically. Key challenges include enhancing follow-up and improving patient compliance with long-term use. 
6. Oral appliance therapy: This includes mandibular advancement devices and tongue retaining devices, treating throat and pharyngeal narrowing. The former works by advancing the mandible to move the tongue forward, enlarging the upper airway, while the latter pulls the tongue forward to prevent it from falling back. It can be tried in mild to moderate SAS patients or those intolerant to CPAP therapy. 
7. Surgical treatment: The main goals of surgical treatment are to bypass the pharyngeal airway susceptible to blockage during sleep, establishing a secondary respiratory pathway, and to remove anatomical constrictions, widening the airway. Surgical methods include tracheostomy, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, septoplasty and turbinectomy for nasal blockages, and surgeries targeting anatomic narrowing of the oropharynx such as maxillomandibular advancement, hyoid suspension, and tongue reduction surgery. Surgical interventions are varied and complex, requiring meticulous preoperative assessments and strict selection criteria, with staged, combined procedures when necessary. 
The prognosis of SAS varies due to the severity and individual differences, and current data on the natural progression of untreated SAS is insufficient. However, there are increasing reports of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications linked to the severity of SAS. Effective treatment can improve symptoms and may reduce morbidity and mortality rates, though prospective study data is currently lacking."
"Presence of chalky white spots, rough tooth surface, and pain",Dental Caries,"The treatment for dental caries aims to halt the progression of the disease and restore the tooth's intrinsic shape and function. 

1. Medication: This approach involves the application of medications to inhibit the progression of dental caries after the removal of carious lesions. It is suitable for shallow caries in permanent teeth that have not yet formed a cavity and shallow to moderate cavities in deciduous anterior teeth. Common medications include Silver Nitrate and Sodium Fluoride. 

2. Amalgam Filling: For teeth with substantial defects, amalgam filling is the most widely used and effective method currently. The procedure involves the removal of carious tissue and unsupported enamel, shaping the cavity appropriately, followed by filling it with restorative material to recover its intrinsic form and function. Appropriate for restoring posterior teeth and concealed cavities in anterior teeth. 

3. Composite Resin Filling: Suitable for filling cavities in anterior teeth and posterior teeth not subjected to chewing forces. 

4. Acid-etch Photopolymerized Composite Resin Filling: Indications are similar to those for composite resin filling, but also include teeth with significant substance loss, poor retention, and covering discolored teeth. 

5. Inlays: Made from metal or other materials fitting the dental cavity, inlays are embedded within, while those covering the occlusal surface are referred to as onlays. Indicated for: a) extensive occlusal surface cavities or posterior teeth susceptible to fracture; b) side cavities where it is impossible to restore the proximal contact with adjacent teeth; c) serving as abutments for semi-fixed bridges."
"Jaundice, yellowing of the skin, weight loss, fatigue",Eosinophilia,"What are the treatment options for eosinophilia? If no underlying cause is identified, follow-up for complications should be conducted in patients. In cases where the condition is reactive and not due to malignant neoplasms, administration of low-dose corticosteroids can reduce eosinophil counts. Corticosteroids are synthesized from cholesterol in the body through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The activity of certain enzymes is particularly high in some endocrine glands or different tissues within the same gland, leading to the production of different hormones."
"Severe pain in the affected area, increased local skin temperature, localized tenderness, swelling",Osteomyelitis,"Treatment options for osteomyelitis include: 
1. Supportive care: This involves adequate rest and good nursing care, attention to fluid and electrolyte balance, frequent small transfusions to prevent pressure sores and oral infections, and providing a diet rich in proteins and vitamins that is easy to digest. Analgesics are used to ensure the patient gets adequate rest. 
2. Pharmacotherapy: Prompt administration of adequate and effective antibiotics is crucial. Initially, broad-spectrum antibiotics are preferred, often in combination, and may later be adjusted based on the results of bacterial culture and sensitivity tests, as well as treatment efficacy. If the fever does not subside after treatment, or if an abscess has formed, drug therapy should be combined with surgical treatment. 
3. Local treatment: The use of appropriate splints or casts to limit movement, elevating the affected limb to prevent deformities, reduce pain, and avoid pathological fractures. If an abscess is not clearly visible, the symptoms are severe, and medications cannot control the condition within 24–48 hours, and there is significant tenderness in the affected bone, early incision and drainage should be performed to prevent the spread of pus and extensive destruction of bone tissue. 
For osteomyelitis resulting from firearm injuries: Firearms cause damage and contamination to soft tissues and bone, presenting a high risk of infection. Therefore, it is essential to perform timely debridement to prevent infection, enhance the body's resistance, and convert open fractures to closed ones. Wound dressing changes and maintaining drainage, along with the use of antibiotics, are necessary to prevent infection. For blast-induced open fractures, thorough debridement is mandatory, and the wound should not be sutured to facilitate drainage. 
For non-firearm-related fractures, timely debridement and wound suturing with the placement of a drainage strip for 48 hours should be pursued to achieve primary healing of the wound, converting the fracture to a closed type. If an infection has occurred, the wound should be expanded early to facilitate drainage, and supportive care and anti-infective treatment should be intensified."
"Palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, poor development, cyanosis",Tetralogy of Fallot,"What are the treatment methods for Tetralogy of Fallot? 
    1. The tetralogy of Fallot primarily affects the right heart, thus care should be taken to protect the hypertrophic right ventricle during surgery. 
    2. Direct suturing or patching of the foramen ovale or atrial septal defect; incision of the narrowed pulmonary valve annulus; thorough resection of hypertrophic muscle bundles in the right ventricular outflow tract; patching of the right ventricular outflow tract incision is sometimes required to ensure patency, achieving satisfactory postoperative right ventricular pressure reduction. 
    3. Cure criteria: Symptoms and cyanosis disappear with no residual shunt or significant complications following surgical correction, including repair of the atrial septal defect, incision of the narrowed pulmonary valve, or widening of the right ventricular outflow tract, generally without restrictions on activities. 
    Treatment strategies: 
    Surgical indications: Once diagnosed, surgery should be aggressively pursued. Symptoms are evident or cyanosis presents with significantly increased right ventricular pressure warranting early surgery. Surgery is also indicated for those with lighter right ventricular hypertrophy or pulmonary valve stenosis but with a significant shunt due to atrial septal defect. 
    Treatment principles and key surgical points: 
    The surgery is completed under cardiopulmonary bypass, which allows for the opening of the aorta after the repair of the atrial defect followed by incision for narrowing of the pulmonary valve or relief of stenosis in the right ventricular infundibulum. 
    In cases requiring widening of the right ventricular outflow tract, excessive resection of the hypertrophic myocardium in the funnel part should be avoided so as not to impair the function of the right ventricle, leading to heart failure. 
    For stenosis of the pulmonary valve, if the valve leaflets are well-developed, merely performing a commissurotomy or patching to widen the right ventricular outflow tract is sufficient. If the valve leaflets are underdeveloped or the valves are severely calcified and dysfunctional, using a uni-valve patch for widening the right ventricular outflow tract across the annulus can be considered."
"Abdominal pain, nausea, indigestion, diarrhea, weight loss",Taeniasis,"What are the treatment methods for Taeniasis? Treatment: Given the risk of concurrent cysticercosis, patients should be isolated and treated promptly and comprehensively. Additionally, personal hygiene practices, such as washing hands before eating and after using the restroom, should be emphasized to prevent autoinfection. The anthelmintic treatment is similar to that for beef tapeworm infection and is quite effective. Praziquantel at a dosage of 5mg/kg body weight can achieve an efficacy of over 95% in treating taeniasis. Recent studies have found that praziquantel treatment for taeniasis might trigger symptoms of concurrent porcine cysticercosis, such as epileptic seizures and severe headaches. In endemic areas where mass treatment is conducted, a minor percentage of patients with taeniasis might also show symptoms of neurocysticercosis. Using praziquantel to treat taeniasis in these cases can cause the death and rupture of cerebral cysticerci, leading to brain edema and inflammatory reactions, potentially resulting in dangerous conditions like brain edema or even herniation. Therefore, for individual taeniasis patients without concurrent cysticercosis, a dosage of 5-10mg/kg body weight is recommended. However, in areas with a high incidence of neurocysticercosis, especially during mass treatment campaigns, a lower dosage of 2.5mg/kg body weight is advisable to maintain high efficacy while avoiding severe side effects. To prevent nausea and vomiting, which could lead to regurgitation of proglottid segments into the stomach or duodenum causing autoinfection and cysticercosis, a small dose of chlorpromazine (12.5mg) may be administered prior to anthelmintic treatment. Two hours after taking the anthelmintic, a laxative such as 50% magnesium sulfate (60ml) should be used. Patients with concurrent neurocysticercosis should be hospitalized and closely monitored during anthelmintic treatment. Generally, intestinal tapeworms can be expelled during treatment for cysticercosis. For detailed methods, refer to cysticercosis treatment. Prognosis: The course of the disease can be prolonged, but the prognosis is generally good."
"Jaundice, ascites, oliguria, anuria, hematuria, fever, loss of appetite, fatigue, fever",Hepatorenal Syndrome,"Treatment options for Hepatorenal Syndrome include: 
1. Treating the primary disease: Since the renal failure in this condition is functional, aggressively improving liver function can have a beneficial effect on kidney function. Surgical interventions, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and interventional therapies targeting intrahepatic tumors and cirrhosis should be actively considered where feasible. 
2. Supportive therapy: Discontinue any medications that could induce uremia or damage the liver, and provide a low-protein, high-sugar diet to alleviate uremia and the progression of hepatic encephalopathy, while also using hepatoprotective enzyme-lowering drugs. 
3. Elimination of triggers: Timely prevention and treatment of common triggers such as upper gastrointestinal bleeding, liver cancer rupture and bleeding, large-volume ascites, high dosage of diuretics, severe infections, and surgeries. 
4. Correction of water, electrolyte, and acid-base balance: Increase urine output and sodium excretion on the basis of replenishing effective blood volume, actively correct imbalances in potassium, sodium, chloride, magnesium, and acid-base. 
5. Volume expansion therapy: Use plasma, whole blood, albumin, or dextran plasma substitutes to expand blood volume, alongside furosemide (Lasix) to reduce vascular resistance and improve renal blood flow. Volume expansion is contraindicated if there is pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. 
6. Use of vasopressor agents: Dopamine and phentolamine can dilate renal vessels, improve renal blood flow, and reduce vascular resistance. 
7. Prostaglandins PGI and 654-2: Both are protective for the kidneys. 
8. Traditional Chinese Medicine: Intravenous drip of Danshen injection can treat functional renal failure and lower BUN levels."
"Fever, rash, eschar, ulceration, lymphadenopathy, erythematous rash, febrile illness, headache, nausea and vomiting, hepatosplenomegaly, facial flushing, high fever, papules",Scrub Typhus,"The treatment options for Scrub Typhus include: 
(1) General treatment: Patients should rest in bed and consume a diet of liquids or semi-liquids that are easily digested and absorbed. Supplemental B vitamins and vitamin C are recommended. Bowel movements should be kept regular with a urine output of around 2000ml/day. 
(2) Etiologic treatment: The following antimicrobial agents can be considered for treatment: 
(a) Macrolides such as erythromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin have shown good efficacy in treating Scrub Typhus. The dosing varies, with a general guideline of 1.2g/day for adults and 25-30mg/(kg·day) for children, administered in 3 to 4 doses orally or 2 to 3 via intravenous infusion for erythromycin. For roxithromycin, the typical adult dose is 300mg/day, and for children, it depends on their weight. Azithromycin and clarithromycin dosages also vary, with the treatment usually lasting 8-10 days. Patients commonly experience rapid defervescence within 24 hours of medication. However, macrolides are not recommended for patients with significant liver impairment. 
(b) Tetracyclines, including tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline, also demonstrate favorable outcomes in treating Scrub Typhus. The usual dosages and treatment durations are similar to macrolides. Tetracyclines are not advised for children under 8 years of age, pregnant women, or nursing mothers due to potential adverse effects. 
(c) Chloramphenicol is effective but should not be the first choice due to the potential risk of inducing aplastic anemia. It is not suitable for infants, pregnant or nursing women. 
(d) Quinolones such as ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are commonly used, with a typical course lasting 8-10 days. However, these are not suitable for children under 8, pregnant, or nursing women. 
Among these antimicrobial categories, macrolides, tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol are more potent against the causative agent of Scrub Typhus, Orientia tsutsugamushi, with patients typically normalizing their body temperatures within 24 hours post-treatment. Quinolones can also normalize patient temperatures within 24-48 hours. Generally, a single antimicrobial agent is adequate, and combination therapy is not necessary. There are indications that rifampin may also be effective. 
Treatment outcomes are better with early diagnosis and initiation of treatment. However, clinical manifestations significantly worsen after the second week of illness, showcasing multi-organ dysfunction and pronounced bleeding tendencies. Beyond the third week, treatment efficacy diminishes, and temperature normalization may take 3-5 days. 
For children and pregnant patients, macrolides like azithromycin and roxithromycin are preferred for etiologic treatment. 
It's noteworthy that antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, carbapenems, and aminoglycosides do not effectively treat Scrub Typhus since the pathogen is an obligate intracellular organism, and these antibiotics struggle to reach intracellular targets. 
Recurrences are rare but possible. In such cases, the same antibiotics used initially are effective again without the reappearance of an eschar. 
(3) Supportive treatment: Appropriate symptomatic treatment measures should be administered promptly for patients presenting with complications or co-infections to improve treatment outcomes."
"Paralysis of limbs, incontinence, paraplegia, muscle atrophy, sensory impairment, paralysis, loss of temperature sensation",Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome,"The treatment modalities for Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome vary depending on the causative factors. In cases related to inflammation, antibiotics or antiviral agents may be administered. Steroids such as dexamethasone or hydrocortisone can be effective in reducing inflammation, decreasing edema, and protecting the neural tissue. Medications enhancing circulation and agents promoting neuronal metabolism are also applicable. Traditional Chinese Medicine generally treats the condition based on the symptoms of muscle weakness and paralysis, with initial strategies involving clearing heat, detoxifying the body, activating blood circulation, removing blood stasis, and unblocking the meridians. In chronic phases, treatments mainly focus on nourishing the liver and kidney. Acupuncture, acupoint injection, massage, and appropriate exercises may assist in recovery. Additionally, early prevention and treatment of complications such as pressure ulcers, hypostatic pneumonia, and cystitis should be emphasized."
"Maculopapular rash, wheezing, urinary and fecal incontinence, low-grade fever, polyuria, polydipsia, diarrhea, dry cough",Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH),"The therapeutic approach to Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) varies considerably, reflecting the heterogeneity of the disease among individuals. It is critical to tailor treatment to the specific needs of each patient. Spontaneous remission may occur in some cases, yet most patients require intervention. Treatment selection is primarily based on the patient's age, extent of lesion involvement, and the presence of functional impairment in vital organs. Currently, therapeutic measures include local lesion excision surgery, local radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. 
1. Lesional Excision: For localized bony lesions, excision of the lesion is the preferred choice, sometimes followed by local radiotherapy. These approaches are generally very effective, often curative, with a low recurrence rate. The same principle applies to isolated lymph node or skin lesions. In some instances, asymptomatic relapsed lesions may spontaneously regress over weeks or months. 
2. Radiation Therapy: With advancements in the understanding of LCH and the development of chemotherapy, the application of radiation therapy has significantly decreased. Indications for radiation therapy include localized lesions with a tendency to expand under clinical observation, bone lesions at weight-bearing sites, and lesions that involve or compress vital organs causing significant functional impairment which cannot be surgically resected."
"Jaundice, ascites, spider nevi, gastrointestinal bleeding, splenomegaly",Ascites,"What are the treatment options for ascites? Treatment of the primary disease: The treatment plan for ascites should be based on the underlying cause. For tuberculous peritonitis, antituberculosis treatment should be administered; purulent peritonitis caused by perforation of abdominal viscera requires surgical treatment; and for malignant ascites, treatment should be tailored to the condition and may include surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or interventional therapy. Basic treatment: This includes bed rest and dietary therapy. The presence of ascites indicates the severity of the disease. Regardless of the cause, basic treatment cannot be overlooked. Bed rest: Resting in bed is extremely important for the recovery of heart, liver, and kidney functions, and is beneficial for the resolution of ascites. On one hand, it can increase liver blood flow, reduce hepatic metabolic load, and promote the reabsorption of ascites through diaphragmatic lymphatic gaps; on the other hand, it can increase renal blood flow, improve renal perfusion, and eliminate water and sodium retention. Dietary therapy: Adequate nutrition and calories are necessary for the recovery from the disease. Nutritional supplementation should vary with the disease. For example, in cases of hypoalbuminemia, proteins and vitamins should be supplemented; for severe renal and liver failure, protein intake should be limited, with a focus on carbohydrates; for hepatic ascites, sufficient calories should be ensured, with daily caloric intake above 2000 Kcal, primarily from carbohydrates, with daily protein intake of 1-1.2g/kg, and in cases of hepatic encephalopathy, daily protein intake should be limited to around 0.5g/kg. A proper amount of fats should be supplemented. To reduce catabolism, it is recommended that patients with cirrhosis eat between meals. Studies, such as one reported by Gauger et al. on 28 patients with refractory hepatic cirrhosis ascites, demonstrated that short-term intravenous administration of 20% lipid emulsion 250ml, every other day, 5-6 times per course, on top of the basic treatment significantly improved patients' spirits and appetite, with ascites disappearing in 16 cases and reducing in 10 cases. This suggests that combining 20% lipid emulsion treatment can help improve refractory hepatic ascites."
"Lower abdominal bulge, discomfort, sensation of dragging or heaviness",Inguinal Hernia,"What are the treatment options for an inguinal hernia? In the absence of surgical contraindications, surgical intervention is generally recommended. Considering that direct hernias rarely become incarcerated, for elderly or frail individuals or those with other chronic diseases who cannot withstand surgery, the use of a truss may alleviate symptoms. 

Since direct hernias do not have a distinct hernia sac neck or hernia sac, the procedure only requires the removal of the protruding slack peritoneum. Sometimes, it can be converted into an indirect hernia and then ligated at a higher position. The repair can be strengthened using the Madden technique to enhance the strength of the transversalis fascia, or the Bassini or Halsted methods to reinforce the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. It must be noted, for large direct hernias, the McVay technique is preferable over the Madden method."
"Hematemesis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, vomiting",Mallory-Weiss Syndrome,"The treatment modalities for Mallory-Weiss Syndrome include conservative methods such as sedation, antiemetic therapy to cease vomiting, reducing or avoiding increases in intra-abdominal pressure, blood volume replenishment, pharmacological hemostasis, and interventional treatments. Surgical intervention, which involves ligating bleeding vessels and suturing the torn mucosa, is considered when conservative treatments fail to achieve hemostasis. Interventional treatment, a minimally invasive technique that bridges the gap between surgery and medicine, encompasses both endovascular and non-vascular procedures. Developed over the past three decades, it now stands alongside surgery and internal medicine as a pivotal discipline. This approach involves creating a small access through the skin or using the body's natural orifices to target lesions directly under the guidance of imaging technologies (e.g., angiography, fluoroscopy, CT, MRI, ultrasound) without the need for open surgery, making it a minimally traumatic therapeutic option."
"Eye pain, photophobia, tearing, eyelid redness and swelling, conjunctival hyperemia, edema",Conjunctivitis,"Treatment strategies for Conjunctivitis include: 
1. Local application of antiviral ophthalmic agents, complemented by systemic antiviral medication. 
2. Use of topical antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infections. 
3. Application of drugs that promote corneal epithelial repair locally, along with oral intake of various vitamins. 
Medication principles: 
1. In the acute phase, alternate the use of two different antiviral eye drops, combined with an antibiotic eye medication. 
2. Oral administration of one to two types of antiviral drugs. 
3. Following inflammation control, add treatments such as Corneal Ning eye drops, Sigao eyelash therapy ointment, and oral multi-vitamins to promote corneal epithelial repair. 
4. Interferon therapy may be considered for severe cases. 
5. Given the high contagion of this condition, mainly through contact, precautions should be taken to prevent transmission."
"Hematuria, jaundice, spider angiomas, palmar erythema, splenomegaly, ascites, edema of legs and feet, eyelid edema",Hepatorenal Syndrome,"The treatment approaches for Hepatorenal Syndrome include: 
1. For Hepatitis B Virus-related glomerulonephritis, it is advised to follow the treatment protocol for primary glomerular diseases. However, the application of corticosteroids might promote HBV replication, and their efficacy is uncertain. Therefore, their use should be approached with caution; antiviral treatment, such as interferon and Chinese herbal medicine, may have certain efficacy. 
2. For cirrhotic glomerulonephritis, specific treatment is generally not required. The focus should be on protecting the liver and preventing further liver damage. For the few cases where renal function deteriorates rapidly or presents with nephrotic syndrome, the diagnostic and treatment principles are the same as for IgA nephropathy. 
3. During Hepatorenal Syndrome, the key lies in treating liver disease and its complications. It is crucial to avoid excessive diuresis and large-volume paracentesis, to be cautious with nephrotoxic drugs, and to correct electrolyte disorder. With the improvement of liver function, moderate volume expansion and diuresis, low-dose dopamine infusion (e.g., dopamine 20mg added to 250ml of low molecular weight dextran for infusion at 15-20D/min), prostaglandin or phentolamine may improve renal hemodynamics. Moderately draining ascites or ascitic fluid filtration and reinfusion can reduce intra-abdominal pressure, benefiting renal blood circulation. Dialysis indications are the same as for chronic renal failure. Surgical treatment may be necessary when required."
"Cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, diarrhea, hepatomegaly, signs of meningismus, pleural effusion, fever, headache, increased intracranial pressure syndrome, expectoration, vomiting",Paragonimiasis,"What are the treatment options for Paragonimiasis? 
1. Etiological treatment 
   (1) Bithionol is the drug of choice with low toxicity, easily absorbed when taken orally, with a short-term cure rate of 84% to 100%, and a long-term efficacy of 80% to 90%. Side effects include dizziness, headache, gastrointestinal reactions, skin rash, etc. Rarely, a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction may occur. If liver damage occurs, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Contraindicated in cases of severe cardiac disease, renal disease, and pregnancy. 
   (2) Praziquantel has high efficacy, short treatment duration, convenient administration, and few side effects, which are only mild dizziness, headache, and fatigue, making it a hopeful medicine for the treatment of Paragonimiasis. 
   (3) Hexachloroparaxylene (BPF-846) also has good efficacy against Paragonimiasis. Side effects include gastrointestinal reactions, headache, dizziness, and occasionally acute hemolytic anemia and psychiatric symptoms. Contraindicated in patients with a history of mental illness, severe liver or kidney disease, and pregnancy. 
   (4) Albendazole 
2. Antibiotic treatment 
   Secondary bacterial infections should be treated with antibiotics. 
3. Surgical treatment 
   For chronic cerebral or spinal forms, combined with compression symptoms, and poor response to medical treatment, surgical intervention may be considered."
Corneal ulceration,Pterygium,"What are the treatment options for pterygium? 
Treatment aims to minimize external stimuli and actively treat chronic inflammation of the eye. 
1. Antibiotic eye drops are used to control conjunctival inflammation and alleviate congestion. Corticosteroid eye drops may be added when congestion is severe. To reduce external irritation, appropriate photochromic glasses can be worn. For inflammatory stimuli, 0.25% chloramphenicol and 0.5% prednisolone eye drops can be applied, with tetracycline and prednisolone eye ointment at night. 
2. Small, static pterygia do not require treatment. If the pterygium is progressive or has approached the pupillary area affecting vision or limiting eye movement, surgical removal may be considered. For patients unwilling to undergo surgery, 0.3ml of 2000-3000U/ml bleomycin solution can be injected into the neck and body of the pterygium under topical anesthesia, once a week, for 3-6 weeks as a course of treatment. To alleviate local reactions, 0.3ml of triamcinolone and tetracycline prednisolone ointment can be injected into the opposite conjunctiva and wrapped. 
3. Cryotherapy involves using a -40°C probe to contact the head and neck of the pterygium, destroying its neovascularization and causing it to shrink. This is used for smaller and thinner pterygia. 
4. Surgical options should aim to safely excise the pterygium entirely, ensure good optical results, and prevent recurrence. Techniques include head transposition, scleral exposure, conjunctival grafting, and advancements such as oral mucosa and amniotic membrane transplantation. Postoperative care should: ensure a flat, evenly positioned graft; use an iris repositor to remove subconjunctival hemorrhage; excise the pterygium thoroughly to maintain a smooth corneal surface while sparing healthy tissue; avoid damaging the tear ridge and tendons to prevent future adhesions or motility issues; remove more conjunctival sub-tissue beneath the pterygium to reduce rapid vascular or tissue proliferation post-surgery; thoroughly remove the corneal edge, sclera, and degenerative tissue on the cornea to prevent fibrovascular invasion. Additionally, supervise regular follow-ups to monitor for recurrence. 
5. Despite improvements in surgical techniques, pterygium recurrence is still a concern, with rates reported by Castroviejo between 25% and 45%. Proper postoperative adjuvant therapy can significantly reduce recurrence rates. These include: 
-Thiotepa, an anticancer drug, applied as an eye drop starting five days post-surgery, every three hours for eight weeks, which may continue for 3-6 months. It inhibits neovascular cell proliferation, preventing nuclear filamentous division. 
-Mitomycin C eye drops, an antiproliferative drug, applied postoperatively 3 times/d for 7 days or 2 times/d for 5 days, maintaining a low recurrence rate and safety. 
-Local corticosteroids post-surgery can inhibit inflammation and corneal edema, thereby preventing neovascularization. Prednisolone 0.5% eye drops or dexamethasone 0.025% eye drops, applied 4 times/d for 6 weeks, are suggested. 
6. Physical therapy options such as β-ray irradiation postoperatively have shown effectiveness in preventing recurrence, with the most commonly used being 90Srβ radiation. The total dose is 2600R, divided into three sessions post-surgery, reducing recurrence to 3.6%. High doses above 1.29C/kg (5000R) may increase the risk of radiation-induced cataracts. 
-Laser treatment using argon laser to photocoagulate the blood vessels in the neck and body of the pterygium can be followed by application of 0.5% prednisolone or 0.1% dexamethasone eye drops. 
Prognosis: Surgery is generally successful with good recovery. Postoperative recurrence is related to the characteristics of the pterygium (such as thickness and congestion), surgical technique, and incorrect operations. Continued exposure to risk factors also plays a significant role."
"Emaciation, abdominal pain, constipation, fatigue",Inguinal Hernia,"Treatment options for Inguinal Hernia include: 
Surgical treatment is recommended for all cases. The key points of the surgery involve first liberating and repositioning the herniated organs, then reconstructing a complete hernia sac before performing a high ligation and hernia repair. 
1. Hernia sac formation and high ligation 
(a) Bevan method: Commonly used for smaller sliding hernias, such as when the cecum has herniated. The procedure starts with an incision of the hernia sac followed by a semicircular incision of the peritoneum 2cm away from the edge of the cecum. The incision ends must reach the neck of the hernia sac, ensuring a complete hernia sac can be formed for high ligation. The cecum is meticulously liberated to the level of the internal ring, being careful not to damage the mesenteric and spermatic cord vessels. The herniated cecum is then repositioned, and the peritoneal semicircular incision ends are brought together and sutured longitudinally, forming a complete hernia sac for high ligation (Figure 1). 
(b) La Roque method: Suitable for larger sliding hernias, such as for herniated sigmoid colon. The front wall of the hernia sac is incised, and the intestine is freed towards the back side up to the internal ring, being cautious not to harm its mesenteric vessels. The abdominal oblique and transverse muscles are separated in the direction of the muscle fibers above the internal ring by 3cm, carefully avoiding damage to the iliohypogastric nerve. The peritoneum is then incised, and the freed herniated intestine is repositioned through the internal ring. 
(c) Ponka method: Suitable for larger sliding hernias. The procedure begins by separating the hernia sac along with the herniated intestine and spermatic cord to the deep side of the internal ring, ensuring not to injure the intestinal mesentery and spermatic vessels. The front wall of the hernia sac is incised, and cuts along both sides of the intestine extend to the deep side of the internal ring. The two cut edges are then sutured behind the liberated side of the intestine to form a complete internal ring, followed by repositioning of the intestine, and performing high ligation of the hernia sac (Figure 3), without the need for peritonealization of the posteriorly freed surface of the intestine. 
2. Hernia repair: Due to the characteristics of a sliding hernia, where the hernia ring is dilated and the strength of the abdominal wall's tendinous layers and transversalis fascia is severely compromised, repair of the internal ring often involves the Bassini method or the use of a mesh patch."
"Diarrhea, urinary urgency, urinary frequency, dysuria, bladder irritation, thermalgia, indigestion, hematuria",Trichuriasis,"The treatment options for trichuriasis include anthelmintic oral medication to promote the expulsion of the worms. For parasites residing within tissues, surgical removal of the worms is recommended."
"Pain in the liver area, chest pain, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, diarrhea, hepatomegaly, nausea and vomiting, splenomegaly, anemia, febrile infection, urticaria-like rash, high fever",Clonorchiasis,"What are the treatment options for clonorchiasis? 
(1) Treatment 
1. Bithionol is a commonly used medication for this disease, with a dosage of 40-60mg/d, taken orally three times a day every other day. A treatment course lasts for 10-15 days, with a 5-7 day gap before starting the next course. Improvement is generally seen from the third day of medication, with body temperature returning to normal within 3-6 days and clinical symptoms, including the swelling of the liver, gradually reducing. 
2. Praziquantel with a dosage of 60mg/(kg·d), taken consecutively for 3 days. The advantage of this medication is its good patient tolerance and short treatment duration. However, some believe its effectiveness is not significant, and in some cases, ineffective. Studies by Mao Xiaoxing and others (1993) using scanning electron microscopy have shown that praziquantel can cause damage to the tegument of the liver fluke, suggesting that increasing the dosage and extending the treatment duration might improve clinical outcomes, albeit further research is needed. 
3. Triclabendazole with a dosage of 10mg/kg body weight, taken as a single dose. This medication was used in veterinary medicine in 1983, first applied to humans in 1989, and recommended by the WHO in 1997. It has been widely used in Egypt, with no reports of its application in China thus far. In addition to treating the pathogen, clonorchiasis treatment should also incorporate other methods, such as selecting sensitive antibiotics to treat concurrent bacterial infections and surgical treatment for obstructive jaundice. 
(2) Prognosis 
Generally good. In the acute phase, extensive hepatic bleeding caused by the mass migration of juvenile worms can lead to death due to misdiagnosis and untimely treatment. Chronic cases may worsen due to concurrent bacterial cholangitis."
Skin depigmentation,Vitiligo,"What are the treatment options for Vitiligo? 
  1. Medication: Once the diagnosis is confirmed by a doctor, the patient should follow the doctor’s advice and take targeted medication. Generally, traditional Chinese medicine takes longer to see effects but has lasting benefits, whereas chemical medication acts faster and can control the condition in a short time. 
  2. Physical therapy can be used in conjunction: A widely used physical therapy approach is steam therapy, which allows medication to act directly on the skin and be absorbed into the bloodstream faster than oral intake, offering a quicker, more comfortable treatment without increasing the liver's burden. Additionally, lifestyle and dietary adjustments during steam therapy can enhance the treatment outcome and effectively prevent the recurrence of the disease. 
  3. Surgical treatment is advised for patients in the stable phase of Vitiligo: For patients with minor skin damage, it is recommended to excise the affected skin directly. For those with more extensive or larger areas of damage, skin grafting or melanocyte transplantation may be considered. However, it is important to note that surgery is not suitable for patients in the active phase of Vitiligo, as it can cause psychological stress, a significant factor in the spread of Vitiligo. Therefore, patients should choose their treatment method based on their specific circumstances."
"Dry skin, itchiness, papules, keratinization, follicular keratotic plugs",Keratosis Pilaris,"There is currently no cure for keratosis pilaris; however, patients can manage their condition with appropriate treatments to improve symptoms. Often, enhancing skin care can reduce the onset of this condition, such as using mild exfoliators and applying moisturizing oils after bathing to protect skin's softness. During the dry winter months, the skin tends to lose more moisture, which can precipitate this condition. Therefore, bathing too frequently and using strong alkaline bath products are not advisable in the winter. Diet-wise, consuming foods rich in Vitamin A, such as carrots, green vegetables, and fresh fruits, can be beneficial. Additionally, applying sunscreen and taking Vitamin C supplements can help reduce recurrences. For mild symptoms, patients can apply moisturizing lotions containing glycolic acid or other exfoliating agents. For more severe cases, topical medications such as 20% urea cream or 0.1% tretinoin cream may be used to alleviate dry skin. For widespread and severe rashes, oral retinoids and Vitamin A might be prescribed. Treatments such as laser and dermabrasion have also shown some efficacy for this condition."
"Itching in the ear, swelling, redness, severe throbbing pain, discharge of pus from the ear canal accompanied by cold aversion and fever",Otitis Externa,"Treatments for otitis externa incorporate various traditional methods, emphasizing the importance of preliminary caution before initiation of any treatment regimen. Key treatments include: 1. Eradicating humidity and itchiness using a combination of Alum and Realgar, applied with a goose feather after mixing with tea for cleansing. 2. Applying Carthamin Ointment, consisting of Carthamin, calcined Dragon's bone, calcined Alum, and ground Talcum, for moisture absorption and tissue repair, changed three times a day. 3. Da Huang San, a blend of Rhubarb, Coptis root powder, and powdered Dragon's bone aids in detoxifying, drying dampness, and promoting tissue recovery. 4. The White Dragon Powder, a concoction of partially calcined Concha Haliotidis, ground Cuttlefish bone, Talcum, Borax, and light powder, is utilized for regeneration and pain relief. 5. Carthamin and Alum are employed in white Alum ash powder for its detoxifying and damp-resolving properties, used daily and re-applied three times. 6. To address persistent ear discharge in children, the mixture of flower Carthamin, Dragon's bone, white Alum ash, and white stone fat as pills are applied, indicating its effectiveness in persistent discharge cases. Additionally, Blow Ear Powder offers a drier alternative with Eupatorium leaves and Aurantium shell for purging dampness and clearing heat. This comprehensive approach, spanning detoxifying, moisture absorbing, and tissue regenerating properties with herbal powders and ointments, signifies a meticulous regimen in treating otitis externa."
"High fever with chills, cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, aversion to cold, chills, fever, fatigue, lymphatic rupture, pneumothorax, chest deformity, and sputum production",Tropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia,"What are the treatment methods for Tropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia? 
1. Etiological Treatment 
(1) Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) is effective against both the adult worms and microfilariae of filariae with better efficacy for Brugian filariasis than Bancroftian filariasis, though the adverse effects are more pronounced for the former. After oral administration, DEC is rapidly absorbed in the intestines and metabolized in the body, with almost all excreted through urine. The trace of DEC is hardly found in the blood 48 days after a single dose. The long-term therapeutic effect is better than the short-term outcome. The drug itself has mild adverse reactions, with high doses occasionally causing nausea, vomiting, dizziness, insomnia, etc. Due to the extensive killing of adult worms and microfilariae during treatment, patients may experience aversion to cold with high fever, headache, muscle pain throughout the body, rash, or even laryngeal edema, among other allergic reactions. Less commonly, there may be pain due to enlarged liver and spleen, hematuria, and proteinuria. Allergic reactions typically occur 6-8 hours after medication, and can be treated or mitigated with antihistamines, aspirin, corticosteroids, and other drugs. 
(2) Levamisole shows immediate efficacy against both B. malayi and W. bancrofti infections, but its long-term efficacy is inferior. Combination therapy with DEC can enhance the effect. Its adverse effects are more significant than those of DEC, mainly including fever, headache, muscle soreness in limbs, and fatigue. Fever usually does not exceed 39°C and lasts 2-3 days, disappearing after the discontinuation of the drug. 
(3) Flubendazole, synthesized in China in 1979, shows significant lethality against adult worms and microfilariae of Bancroftian filariasis. Its adverse reactions are similar to those of DEC. 
(4) A single dose of DEC or a combination of a single dose of DEC with a single dose of Ivermectin has been shown to be effective in treating filariasis, with the combination therapy proving to be more effective. 
2. Symptomatic Treatment 
Early allergic reactions manifesting as fever, cough, and asthma can be treated with antihistamines such as chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton), loratadine, or cetirizine (Zyrtec), and corticosteroids. Pleural effusion leading to chest tightness and dyspnea should be treated with thoracentesis."
"Cough, chest tightness, headache, fatigue, low fever",Simple Pulmonary Eosinophilia,"Treatment for Simple Pulmonary Eosinophilia generally is not necessary. However, if drug-induced, the causative medication should be discontinued immediately. For cases caused by parasites, anthelmintic treatment can be administered. If symptoms are significant or recurrent, corticosteroids may be used."
"Papules and erythema on the glans penis, a burning sensation and itching of the glans penis",Balanoposthitis,"Various treatment approaches for balanoposthitis include: 
General treatments include maintaining local hygiene to prevent secondary infections; for exudation and erosion, 3% boric acid solution or 0.1% rifamycin wet dressing can be used; non-infectious subacute phase may utilize corticosteroid creams; and for chronic phase or dry desquamation, tetracycline hydrocortisone ointment is suitable. In cases of significant infection, fever, and lymphadenopathy, systemic antibiotics such as cefalexin, 0.5g orally 3–4 times/day, or fluoroquinolones, 0.2g twice daily, can be administered. For those with phimosis, a circumcision is recommended after inflammation subsides. 
Phototherapy - The novel red light therapy, based on the differential absorption of specific wavelengths of light energy by normal and pathological tissues, applies infrared radiation to local lesions. This promotes local metabolism, enhances biological immune function, stimulates cell vitality, accelerates the regeneration of damaged nerves, improves leukocyte phagocytosis, and enhances the nutritional status of local tissues, achieving healing objectives without adverse effects on normal tissues. This therapy has demonstrated superior efficacy compared to traditional treatments and also serves an analgesic purpose in early and middle stages of inflammation. 
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Treatment Options: 
For Liver Meridian Damp-Heat syndrome, characterized by redness, swelling, and burning pain of the glans penis and foreskin, yellow discharge with a foul smell, bitterness in the mouth, dry throat, irritability, dark yellow urine, and constipation. The tongue is red with a yellow greasy coating, and the pulse is wiry and rapid. The treatment principle is to clear the Liver, promote diuresis, detoxify, and reduce swelling. Prescriptions include Longdan Xiegan Tang for primary formula, along with compound andrographis tablets orally, 4 tablets three times daily, compound bromelain tablets orally, 4 tablets three times daily, and individualized formula compound Zhizi Sanhua Decoction by Xie Yida. For Liver Meridian Toxic Fire syndrome, where symptoms include swollen glans penis and foreskin with a purple hue, necrosis, exuding bloody fluid, yellow-white pus around the urethral meatus with a fishy smell, and intense pain at the ulcers. The heart feels irritable and hot, with thirst for cold drinks, scorching and painful urination, constipation, a red tongue with a thick, yellow, and dry coating, and a slippery, rapid pulse. The treatment principle is to clear and drain Liver Gallbladder fire. The primary formula includes Danggui Luohui Pills (from 'Medical Six Books'), with the prescription composed of a blend of herbs listed for water decoction. External treatment methods and specifics on other syndrome types, such as Yin Deficiency Fire Poison type, are also provided, catering to various manifestations of balanoposthitis."
"Eyelid edema, fever, cough, headache",Orbital Cellulitis,"The treatment of orbital cellulitis includes: 1. Extensive use of sulfonamides and antibiotics (penicillin, cephalosporin, clindamycin) and, if necessary, combination with hormone therapy. 2. Bed rest, hydration, maintenance of electrolyte balance, and antipyretic therapy. 3. Local warm compresses or ultrashort wave therapy. In cases where an abscess forms, incision and drainage may be performed, and the primary focus of infection should also be appropriately treated. 4. Traditional Chinese Medicine approaches: In the early stages of the disease, those with prevailing wind symptoms should receive wind-dispelling and detoxifying treatments; those with prevailing heat toxins should receive heat-clearing and detoxifying treatments; and those with deficiency and exuberant toxins, showing poor pus drainage, should receive treatments that support the correct Qi and detoxify."
"Papules, Scaling, Pustules, Pruritus",Lichen Scrofulosorum,"The treatment of Lichen Scrofulosorum can be divided into two main aspects: symptomatic treatment and specific treatment for tuberculosis. The principles of tuberculosis treatment need to be strictly followed, including early treatment, comprehensive treatment, appropriate dosing, regular medication, and combined use of drugs. Currently, for pulmonary tuberculosis, medications such as Streptomycin, Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Ethionamide, and Pyrazinamide can be selected, focusing on protecting liver function for systemic treatment. For lesions with ulceration, Mupirocin ointment can be considered for topical application."
"Ascites, hepatomegaly, jaundice, edema of the lower extremities, pigment abnormalities",Budd-Chiari Syndrome,"Treatment methods for Budd-Chiari Syndrome include: Medical treatment: (1) Supportive and symptomatic treatment: Supportive therapy can buy time and create conditions for a definitive diagnosis and surgical treatment. Diuretics are administered to patients with ascites. Esophageal varices hemorrhage and hepatic encephalopathy should be treated accordingly. (2) Anticoagulation and thrombolysis: Patients with BCS caused by thrombosis should receive timely thrombolytic and anticoagulation therapy. (3) Etiological treatment: For patients with a clear cause or inducer, it should be removed, such as antiparasitic treatment for parasitic infections. Early discontinuation of oral contraceptives causing BCS, while providing liver protection, diuresis, and symptomatic treatment. Secondary to polycythemia vera could be managed with venesection, radio-phosphorus or myelosuppressive drugs such as chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, or hydroxyurea. For patients secondary to paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, ingestion of large doses of alkaline drugs or intravenous infusion of dextrose can temporarily alleviate hemolysis. Corticosteroids can control the onset of hemoglobinuria, and testosterone propionate has a certain effect. Resection or embolization therapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are options for tumors causing BCS. For inflammatory bowel disease or collagen disease, corticosteroids can be used to control the activity of the disease. Surgical treatment: Since 1948, when the first successful splenorenal venous shunting for treating a case of Budd-Chiari Syndrome was reported by Blakemore, surgical treatments have shown promising outcomes compared to medical treatments. It is now generally recognized that relieving hepatic vein and/or inferior vena cava obstruction surgically is the most ideal treatment approach. The selection of surgical method should be based on the pathological type and the location, extent, and degree of the obstruction. Types of surgery include: (1) Portosystemic shunting: This reduces portal venous pressure and hepatic sinusoidal pressure, preventing further liver cell damage and even leading to normal or only mildly fibrotic liver functions. For patients with patent inferior vena cava and hepatic vein obstruction, common surgical options are side-to-side portocaval shunt, mesocaval shunt, and end-to-side splenorenal shunt; when significant liver congestion enlarges, making the exposition of the portal vein, especially the caudate lobe enlarged, changing the normal anatomical position of portal vein and inferior vena cava, and causing difficulty in side-to-side anastomosis, some scholars recommend the “H” shaped bridging shunt, using a transplanted vessel placed between the mesenteric vein and the inferior vena cava, performing end-to-side anastomoses with both the inferior vena cava and the 'surgical trunk' of the mesenteric vein. To avoid shunt thrombosis, the “H” shaped shunt has been modified to a “C” shaped shunt in some cases. (2) Membranectomy: For patients with membranous obstruction of inferior vena cava or short segment stenosis without hepatic vein obstruction, initial intervention might involve Seldinger technique with balloon catheter dilation and stent placement. Failed intervention, recurrence, or thrombosis beneath the septum may necessitate surgical excision of the obstructive membrane or lesion under direct vision. (3) Cavo-atrial shunt: This surgical option is considered for long segment inferior vena cava obstruction without hepatic vein obstruction or when local excision of membranous or short segmental obstruction is difficult. (4) Radical corrective surgery: Employed for localized obstruction, with fresh thrombus formation, when thrombolysis is ineffective, or in cases with obstructions 1～6cm in length (including thrombotic cases), or when obstruction at the hepatic vein outlet needs to be addressed, or in the presence of a foreign body, or in pediatric cases. The surgery involves opening the thorax through the right 6th rib, opening the diaphragm, establishing extracorporeal circulation (optional), excising the diseased segment under direct vision, and reconstructing vascular continuity with a graft or bridge. (5) Peritoneal-venous shunt: This surgery is effective for treating ascites but is deemed palliative as it does not reverse the pathophysiological changes caused by hepatic vein and/or inferior vena cava obstruction. It is considered when other surgical options are not feasible or have failed, and ascites become a prominent issue, to relieve patient suffering and prolong life. (6) Orthotopic liver transplantation: First used by Putnam and others in 1976 for treating BCS. Glenn reported a 5-year survival rate of 44.7% in 23 advanced stage patients treated with liver transplantation, with multiple thromboembolic complications being the main cause of death post-surgery. Campbell reported an 88% 3-year cumulative survival rate after surgery with long-term anticoagulation therapy. Orthotopic liver transplantation is mainly used for fulminant hepatic failure and late-stage cirrhosis. Postoperative complications and management: (1) Heart failure: A common postoperative complication. Sudden increase in the volume of blood returning to the heart after relieving hepatic vein and/or inferior vena cava obstruction can exacerbate the burden on an already compromised heart, leading to heart failure. To prevent heart failure, immediate cardiotonic and diuretic treatments, including digoxin 0.4mg and furosemide 10-40mg IV, are beneficial in reducing the occurrence of heart failure. (2) Ascites or chylous ascites: Pre-surgical inferior vena cava obstruction hampers return flow, causing plasma to leak into liver lymphatic interspaces under the condition of no egress for hepatic venous blood, leading to stubborn and difficult-to-resolve ascites. Some patients may develop chylous ascites due to the rupture of high-pressure lymphatic vessels. Intraoperatively, damage to dilated lymphatic vessels is more likely, resulting in chylous ascites. For chylous ascites, oral administration of octreotide may accelerate resolution, and large volume ascites can be drained through peritoneal tapping. Surgical exploration to ligate the ruptured lymphatic vessels may be necessary for some cases. Chylothorax can be effectively managed by draining the effusion as much as possible and injecting tetracycline or erythromycin plus procaine, which often yields good results. (3) Hemothorax: Minor hemothorax requires close observation. If bleeding is significant (more than 100ml/h), thoracotomy for hemostasis should be promptly conducted. If caused by anticoagulation treatment, relevant monitoring indicators should be closely watched, and anticoagulant medications and dosages adjusted timely. (4) Hepatic encephalopathy: Since the liver function in Budd-Chiari Syndrome cases is often better than in cirrhosis cases, the occurrence rate of hepatic encephalopathy post portosystemic shunt is not high (<15%), and many episodes can be prevented with dietary attention. Moderate to severe cases should be managed as hepatic encephalopathy. (5) Artificial vascular occlusion: If thrombosis formation is suspected, blood flow Doppler can be utilized to detect clotting at the site of the artificial vessel. When conditions allow, ultrasound, indirect mesenteric vein angiography, or direct puncture angiography of the artificial vessel can be performed to examine the patency of the artificial vessel. Postoperative anticoagulation therapy can prevent occlusion. (6) Pulmonary embolism: Treatment for pulmonary embolism may include thrombolytic agents (urokinase, streptokinase, r-tPA, etc.) for thrombolysis. Besides systemic intravenous administration, interventional local thrombolysis can also be considered. Extracorporeal circulation establishment for pulmonar artery thrombectomy is an option when conditions permit. (7) Others: Including mediastinal effusion, lung abscess, chylothorax, etc., are less common. Symptoms can be cured through symptomatic treatment if they occur."
"Conjunctival hyperemia, tearing, red eyes, eyelid edema, burning sensation in eyes, itchy eyes, difficulty opening eyes, swelling",Conjunctivitis,"What are the treatment methods for conjunctivitis? General care includes: (1) Conducting three-level nursing care according to eye diseases; (2) Providing psychological care by explaining the condition to the patient, alleviating fear, and encouraging treatment acceptance; (3) Focusing on preventive education and carrying out disinfection and isolation measures thoroughly. Since conjunctivitis is highly infectious, enhance health education; avoid rubbing eyes with hands, patients should not share towels or basins, items used by patients should be washed and thoroughly disinfected promptly, and eye drops must be for individual use. Special care includes: (1) If there is excessive secretion, conjunctival sac irrigation should be done by flipping the eyelid to rinse the conjunctival surface while manually moving the upper and lower lids to flush out secretions from the fornix; (2) For acute catarrhal conjunctivitis, hot compresses are contraindicated and should not be applied; (3) For gonococcal conjunctivitis, treatment should be prompt to attempt rescue, with frequent and timely administration of medication. If one eye is affected, the healthy eye should be protected with a transparent eye shield. Contaminated items should be thoroughly washed and disinfected, and dressings incinerated; (4) Patients with allergic conjunctivitis should wear tinted protective glasses during the season of onset to block sunlight and prevent irritation from sunlight and airborne dust and pollen, inquire about allergy history, and eliminate allergens."
"Reddening of the skin, headache, bleeding",Polycythemia Vera,"Treatment options for Polycythemia Vera include: 

Venesection: Venesection quickly reduces the blood volume to normal, alleviates symptoms, and decreases the chances of bleeding and thrombosis formation. Bloodletting of 200-400ml every 2-3 days until the red blood cell count is below 6.0×10¹²/L and the hematocrit is below 50%. A single venesection can maintain the therapeutic effect for more than one month. This method is straightforward and can be adopted first. Younger patients, without thrombotic complications, may be treated solely with phlebotomy. However, rebound increases in red blood cells and platelets may occur after bloodletting, and repeated venesection could exacerbate an iron deficiency. Caution is advised for elderly patients and those with cardiovascular diseases, with no more than 200-300ml removed at a time and potentially extended intervals between sessions. Cell separation allows the selective removal of a large volume of red blood cells but requires the supplementation of an equal volume of isotype plasma. During venesection, intravenous fluid replacement is also necessary to dilute the blood. 

Chemotherapy: 
(1) Hydroxyurea, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, effectively suppresses polycythemia vera without inducing leukemia. The daily dosage is between 15-20mg/kg. If white blood cell count is maintained at 3.5-5×10⁹/L, hydroxyurea can be used long-term intermittently. 
(2) Alkylating agents have an 80%-85% efficacy rate. Cyclophosphamide and chlormethine (mustine) work rapidly, while busulfan and melphalan have longer remission periods, with treatment effects lasting about six months. Melphalan has fewer side effects, particularly reducing the risk of thrombocytopenia, which is an advantage. Alkylating agents carry a lower risk of inducing leukemia compared to radioactive nucleotides. Dosage and method for alkylating agents include an initial dose of cyclophosphamide at 100-150 mg/day, and for busulfan, mustine, and melphalan at 4-6 mg/day. After remission, a maintenance dose of cyclophosphamide at 50 mg/day or busulfan at 2 mg/day or every other day after a 4-week break. 
(3) Podophyllotoxin derivative: China's reports suggest a dosage of 2-4mg added to 10% glucose solution for intravenous infusion once daily, continuously, or intermittently until the hematocrit and hemoglobin levels return to normal. The average time to achieve remission is 60 days, with a median remission period of over 18 months. 

Alpha-interferon therapy: Interferons have an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and have been used in recent years for the treatment of this disease at a dose of 3 million U/m², three times a week, administered subcutaneously. After 3 months of treatment, the spleen size reduces, and the number of venesections decreases. The remission rate can reach 80%. 

Radioactive nucleotide therapy: The beta radiation from Phosphorus-32 (32P) inhibits nuclear division and reduces cell counts. The initial oral dose is between 11.1×10⁷ and 14.8×10⁷ Bq, with red blood cell counts starting to decline after about 6 weeks, and reaching near-normal levels in 3-4 months, thereby alleviating symptoms with an efficacy rate of 75%-80%. If there is no remission after 3 months, a second dosage may be administered. The average remission time is 2-3 years. There is a risk of transition to leukemia with 32P, which has led to a decrease in its use in recent years. The prognosis is generally poor, with many deaths due to venous thrombosis, severe bleeding, or progression to myelofibrosis and acute leukemia."
"Red eye, conjunctival congestion, eyelid redness and swelling, eye itchiness, burning sensation in the eye, tearing, epiphora",Conjunctivitis,"What are the treatment options for conjunctivitis?
1. Topical Treatment
  (1) Irrigation of the conjunctival sac primarily serves for cleansing, commonly using normal saline, 2%–3% boric acid solution, or 1:5000–1:10000 mercuric chloride (or potassium permanganate) solution.
  (2) Do not cover the affected eye, as a lot of secretions are present during conjunctivitis. Covering the eye obstructs the discharge of secretions, accumulating them within the conjunctival sac; moreover, covering increases the temperature of the conjunctival sac, which favors bacterial proliferation, exacerbating the conjunctivitis.
  (3) Local medications involving antimicrobial or antiviral eye drops should be selected based on the etiological diagnosis. Commonly, 0.5%–1% silver nitrate is used; during application, the eyelid should be turned, and the eye solution dropped on the lid's conjunctiva. After dropping the eye solution, wait for a moment before rinsing with saline. Alternatively, a cotton swab can be dipped in a small amount of the medication and applied to the surface of the lid's conjunctiva, immediately rinsed with saline.
2. Systemic Treatment
  For severe cases of conjunctivitis, such as gonococcal conjunctivitis or trachoma, combined systemic medication is required."
"Papules, itching, severe pain",Keratosis Pilaris,"There is no specific cure for Keratosis Pilaris. Treatments include: 

1. Systemic treatments involve avoiding sun exposure, oral administration of chloroquine (250 mg, twice daily), and potentially using vitamin A (50,000 to 100,000 IU, three times daily) or isotretinoin (0.5 to 1 mg/kg, twice daily). 

2. Topical treatments for less severe and smaller affected areas may include cryotherapy, electrocautery, or laser treatment. Topically applied keratolytics such as 10% salicylic acid ointment or 0.1% tretinoin cream can also be used. 

3. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) recommends nourishing the blood and moisturizing the skin with preparations such as Runfu Wan, Wenjing Tang, or Cangzhu Gao. 

Prognosis: Keratosis Pilaris typically begins to appear between the ages of 30 and 40 and may develop slowly over several years. Excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, similar to treatments used in psoriasis patients, can exacerbate or prolong the condition of Disseminated Superficial Actinic Porokeratosis (DSAP). It may start in infancy or childhood. The genetic traits have not been clearly defined. It can occur alongside other clinical types. Reports of worsening conditions exist."
"Abdominal pain, chest pain, rusty sputum, cough with sputum, fever, diarrhea, cough, abnormal breathing, rales, nausea and vomiting, 'rotten peach' blood sputum",Paragonimiasis,"Treatment options for Paragonimiasis include:
  1. Symptomatic treatment focuses on the care of patients with hemoptysis and those with cerebral and spinal forms, administering the appropriate medication for symptomatic relief.
  2. Antiparasitic treatment:
     (1) Praziquantel: Provides effective treatment for this condition. The total dosage of 120–150mg/kg is divided into 2-3 doses consumed within 2 days, showing significant therapeutic effects. Patients with cerebral involvement should receive two treatment courses, with a one-week interval. Side effects are mild and disappear after discontinuation of the drug.
     (2) Bithionol: Administered at 1.5–3.0g, or 40–50mg/kg per day, divided into three doses, taken daily or every other day. For pulmonary type, the treatment course lasts 10–15 days; the cerebral type may require 2-3 repeated courses. Calcified, atrophic, and inactive lesions are irresponsive. Pre-treatment with anthelmintic drugs may be required for intestinal parasites. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and irritation of the mouth or anus, but disappear after discontinuation. During antiparasitic treatment, some cases may experience a heterologous protein reaction, manifesting as urticaria; severe cases may lead to anaphylactic shock or laryngeal edema, for which corticosteroids are indicated, and medication is temporarily discontinued. It is contraindicated in pregnant women and individuals with severe heart, liver, or kidney diseases.
  3. Surgical intervention: Effective for cerebral and spinal forms of paragonimiasis with compression symptoms. However, surgery may not be effective for atrophic lesions; abdominal and nodular forms might require surgery if necessary."
"Head relatively larger, facial appearance resembles an 'old man', alert reactions, emaciation, varying degrees of malnutrition, subcutaneous fat deficiency in limbs, loose skin, excessive wrinkling, easy desquamation. Cranial sutures may be widened or overlapping, larger anterior fontanelle, fingernails and toenails.",Dwarfism,"The treatment methods for Dwarfism include: 
1) Maintaining warmth; 
2) Given the infant's lean appearance and the tendency towards hypoglycemia, it is crucial to initiate feeding within 30 minutes after birth, primarily with breast milk. For those with good sucking and digesting capabilities, feed on demand, quickly increasing milk volume to aim for a daily caloric intake of 100 Cal/kg to 120 Cal/kg. For those with weak sucking abilities, intravenous supplementation with 10% glucose solution is recommended to prevent hypoglycemia symptoms; 
3) Actively treating various diseases after birth, with general recovery criteria being the child's weight reaching the normal weight for the age, normal body temperature and life capacity, steady breathing, and strong sucking power. Improvement criteria include weight reaching the lower limit of normal weight for the age, general condition improvement, steady breathing, and good sucking and swallowing, but with unstable body temperature and physiological jaundice not completely subsided, requiring ongoing observation and treatment."
"Fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, pale stool, joint pain, jaundice",Hepatitis C,"What are the treatment methods for Hepatitis C? 
The necessity for Hepatitis C treatment varies as the Hepatitis C virus manifests across six genotypes, each responding differently to treatments. Thorough screening is essential before commencing any treatment to identify the most suitable treatment plan. 
Historically, combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin has been the principal treatment for Hepatitis C. However, interferon is not universally accessible and often not well tolerated, with some genotypes responding better to interferon than others. Moreover, a significant number of patients treated with interferon do not complete their treatment course. Consequently, while Hepatitis C is generally considered curable, many fail to achieve a cure. 
Scientific advancements have led to the development of new antiviral drugs for Hepatitis C, which may be more effective and better tolerated than existing treatments. Recently, new drugs such as telaprevir and boceprevir have been approved in some countries. Extensive efforts are needed to ensure that, with these advancements, therapy becomes accessible to more infected individuals worldwide."
"Amenorrhea, galactorrhea, hyperprolactinemia, female infertility, myxedema, lobular hyperplasia of mammary glands, oligomenorrhea, menstrual disorders, anovulation, ovarian dysfunction, estrogen deficiency, abnormal sweating",Galactorrhea-Amenorrhea Syndrome,"Treatment options for Galactorrhea-Amenorrhea Syndrome include: 
1. Etiological treatment, which encompasses: 
   (a) Withdrawal from causative medications (including oral contraceptives) generally leads to natural recovery. If menstruation does not resume six months post-withdrawal, pharmacological treatment may be used. 
   (b) Primary hypothyroidism is treated with thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Avoid using bromocriptine solely based on galactorrhea or amenorrhea symptoms, as it can exacerbate the condition by inhibiting TSH secretion through hypothalamic suppression. 
   (c) For patients with intracranial tumors, surgical removal or radiation therapy is administered as per the condition. Clinical observations suggest that pharmacological treatment alone is superior to surgery or radiation for prolactinoma patients with infertility, as it's less invasive and aids in the recovery of the gonadal axis. Nonetheless, surgery is recommended for patients with macroadenomas presenting with compression symptoms, ineffective bromocriptine treatment, or non-secreting pituitary adenomas with decreased D2 receptors. Bromocriptine treatment before and after surgery can enhance its effectiveness. 
2. Pharmacological treatment includes: 
   (a) Bromocriptine, a semi-synthetic ergoline derivative and a dopamine receptor agonist, inhibits prolactin synthesis and secretion, and directly affects the pituitary tumor and PRL cells, suppressing tumor growth and secretion of PRL, GH, TSH, and ACTH. It is the preferred treatment for various types of hyperprolactinemia and especially in young patients wishing to conceive. 
   (b) Levodopa metabolizes into dopamine in the body, releasing PIF and reducing prolactin levels while increasing gonadotropin levels. 
   (c) Cabergoline (CV205-502), a non-ergoline dopamine agonist, targets the same indications as bromocriptine and is especially suitable for patients who cannot tolerate bromocriptine, or when treatment is ineffective or relapse occurs. 
   (d) Vitamin B6 increases the conversion rate of dopamine in the hypothalamus, thereby enhancing the effect of PIF. 
3. Ovulation induction therapy is employed when bromocriptine alone fails to induce ovulation and pregnancy. 
4. Surgical and radiation therapy are considered when pharmacological treatment is ineffective, when tumors cause significant compression symptoms, or when concurrent hormone-secreting tumors are present."
"Muscle soreness, fever with abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, convulsions, abdominal pain",Campylobacter Enteritis,"The treatment of Campylobacter Enteritis includes two main approaches: general measures and specific antimicrobial therapy. 

General measures involve gastrointestinal isolation. The patient's feces must be thoroughly disinfected, with the isolation period lasting from the onset of illness until fecal cultures turn negative. For patients experiencing significant fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, symptomatic treatment is provided along with bed rest. A diet of easily digestible semi-liquid foods is recommended, and fluid replenishment may be necessary when needed. 

For antimicrobial therapy, the bacterium is sensitive to gentamicin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, kanamycin, neomycin, tetracyclines, and clindamycin, while it exhibits resistance to penicillin and cephalosporins. The choice of antibiotic can be based on clinical conditions. Erythromycin is a choice for enteritis, administered orally at 0.8-1.2g/day for adults and 40-50mg/kg/day for children, over a course of 2-3 days. Quinolone antibiotics, such as ofloxacin, also yield good efficacy but may affect bone development in young children. For bacterial endocarditis, gentamicin is preferred; for meningitis, chloramphenicol is the first choice. For severe infections, the treatment course should be extended to 3-4 weeks to prevent relapse."
"Inflammatory cell infiltration, pale and swollen tongue, root of the tongue abscess, white patches, erosion, pain",Oral Leukoplakia,"Treatment options for Oral Leukoplakia include:

1. For epithelial simple hyperplasia or simple white keratosis, all local irritating factors should be eliminated, and smokers should quit smoking.

2. White patches suspected of malignant transformation, such as verrucous, granular, and erosive lesions, should be surgically removed, treated with cryotherapy or CO2 laser therapy. Patients who have been treated should be periodically followed up to promptly detect and treat any recurrence.

3. The application of 0.3% tretinoin cream locally for one to several weeks can lead to the regression of leukoplakia. Tretinoin inhibits epidermal keratinization. After the lesion regresses and treatment is stopped, recurrence may occur, but reapplication of tretinoin remains effective.

4. Vitamin A and Vitamin E. Vitamin A helps maintain the integrity and health of epithelial tissue structure and is considered by some to have significance in preventing epithelial malignancy. Vitamin E has a beneficial effect on metabolism and strong antioxidant properties, preventing the oxidation of Vitamin A and facilitating its absorption. Vitamin A is taken orally at a dose of 250,000 IU three times a day. Vitamin E is taken at a dose of 50mg three times a day."
"Opacity, thickening, uneven surface, brittleness, nail stratification, discoloration, nail plate lifting, nail plate atrophy, nail plate detachment, hook nail, and paronychia",Onychomycosis,"The treatment methods for onychomycosis include: 1) General management: Avoid scratching the skin lesions on other body parts with hands. Keep fingers and toes clean to prevent infection. Improve diet and lifestyle, and pay attention to mental health management. 2) Treat concurrent tinea infections aggressively. 3) Antifungal therapy, specifically the use of drugs such as ciclopirox. 4) Surgical treatment: Removal of the affected nail(s), in conjunction with topical antifungal therapy."
"Hemoptysis, bronchial hemorrhage, hematemesis and melena, hematuria, epistaxis",Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC),"The treatment principles for DIC are sequential, timely, individualized, and dynamic. Main treatments include management of the underlying disease and removal of inducing factors, anticoagulation therapy, replacement of coagulation factors, antifibrinolytic therapy, thrombolytic treatment, and symptomatic management. Aside from symptomatic treatment, it is often advocated to concurrently proceed with other treatments as deemed necessary. However, recent years have seen a tendency towards sequential treatment, meaning that various therapies are carried out one after another in the order mentioned above, proceeding to the next only if the current treatment does not achieve satisfactory results. 1. Management of the underlying disease and removal of inducing factors such as controlling infections, treating tumors, handling obstetric diseases and traumas, correcting shock, hypoxia, and acidosis, etc. 2. Anticoagulation therapy remains to be a crucial measure to halt the pathological process of DIC, alleviate organ damage, and restore the balance between coagulation and anticoagulation. (1) Heparin Therapy: Indications for heparin therapy include, but are not limited to, incompatible blood transfusions, amniotic fluid embolism, acute leukemia or other tumors, septic abortion, fulminant purpura, heat stroke, underlying hypercoagulable states like eclampsia, nephrotic syndrome, cardiopulmonary diseases, diabetes, etc., subacute or chronic DIC, early stages of acute DIC, among others. Usage of heparin still remains controversial in cases such as infectious DIC, severe hepatic DIC, and neonatal DIC. Contraindications include patients with recent surgeries or wounds without proper hemostasis, recent severe hemoptysis from tuberculosis, active peptic ulcers with significant bleeding, DIC induced by snake venom, and late-stage patients with multiple coagulation factor deficiencies and significant fibrinolysis. The dose of heparin has been emphasized on 'adequate dosage'. In acute DIC, conventional heparin (sodium heparin) could be used ranging from 45,000 to 90,000 U/day. Recent understanding of heparin's action and the improvement of formulations have led to a trend of using smaller dosages to reduce or mitigate bleeding complications. The regular heparin dosage for acute DIC ranges from 15,000 to 45,000 U/day, typically around 15,000 U/day, without exceeding 7,500 U every 6 hours, and can be continued for 3-5 days according to the clinical situation. Low-molecular-weight heparin (e.g., Tinzaparin, Innohep) compared to regular heparin, has higher bioavailability, stronger anti-factor Xa activity, weaker antithrombin activity, less dependence on AT-III, less likely to induce thrombocytopenia, and has slower anticoagulation effects with fewer bleeding complications. It is widely used with a common dose of 75-150 U/(kg·d) for 5 consecutive days. Observations by Japanese scholars suggest a 75 U/(kg·d) dose to be more safe and effective. Conventionally, heparin was administered via continuous intravenous infusion to maintain a steady and safe plasma anticoagulation concentration. Recently, subcutaneous injections every 6 hours have been advocated. Low-molecular-weight heparin is also administered subcutaneously every 6 hours based on clinical conditions for a continuous period of 3-5 days. (2) Other anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs: Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) or compound Danshen injection has been shown through experimental and clinical studies to possess certain anticoagulant and antiplatelet effects, and has been used in DIC treatment with confirmed efficacy, safety, without the need for strict hematological monitoring, and with no notable adverse reactions. It can be used in conjunction with heparin to reduce the latter's dosage or as the primary anticoagulant in chronic DIC, suspected cases, or when confirmatory diagnostic and hematological monitoring facilities are not available. The recommended dose is 20-40 mL of compound Danshen injection added to 100-200 mL of 5% glucose injection solution for rapid intravenous infusion, 2-4 times/day, for a continuous period of 3-5 days. Dextran 40 glucose injection has antiplatelet, volume supplementation, and microcirculation improvement effects; it has certain auxiliary therapeutic value for DIC with a common dosage of 500 mL per time for intravenous drip, not exceeding 1000 mL per day, and can be continued for 3-5 days. Dipyridamole inhibits platelet aggregation by inhibiting the metabolism of cAMP within platelets, thus possessing certain anti-thrombotic effects. The usual dosage is 200-500 mg placed in 100-200 mL of infusion solution for intravenous drip, 2-3 times/day, with a slow drip rate to avoid local vascular irritation. Antithrombin III (AT-III): Recent studies have indicated consumptive reduction of AT-III levels in approximately 80% of acute DIC patients. This can not only lower the body's anticoagulant activity, accelerating and exacerbating the DIC pathological process but also result in poor heparin treatment outcomes and an increase in bleeding complications. Timely and appropriate supplementation of AT-III is hence one of the key measures in DIC treatment. When no AT-III preparations are available, whole blood or plasma with AT-III 1U or 2U per mL respectively can be used. Aspirin exerts antiplatelet effects by inhibiting prostaglandin metabolism, mainly used in chronic or subacute DIC, with a dosage of 50-250 mg, 2-3 times/day, which can be continued for 5-10 days or longer. Ticlopidine is an antiplatelet drug that inhibits platelet aggregation by stabilizing platelet membranes and suppressing ADP-induced platelet aggregation. It has been used clinically for the prevention and treatment of cerebral thrombosis. Given the important role of platelet activation in DIC, this drug can be utilized in the treatment of acute and chronic DIC, with a dosage of 250 mg, twice/day, for a total of 5-7 days. Its main side effect is a tendency towards bleeding. Other traditional Chinese medicines: Domestic literature reports that Chuanxiong, Panax notoginseng, Carthamus tinctorius (safflower), peach kernel, Andrographis paniculata, and several other Chinese herbal medicines with varying degrees of anticoagulant or antiplatelet effects, either used alone or in combination, have been applied as adjunctive treatments for DIC and have achieved relatively good results. Among them, Chuanxiong has a venous injection formulation, with a dosage of 20-30 mL, once or twice/day, which can be continued for more than a week. 3. Platelet and Coagulation Factor Supplementation Indications: (1) Patients have clear evidence of significant platelet or coagulation factor reduction. (2) The causative factors have been removed and anticoagulant treatment has been administered, but DIC has not been adequately controlled. (3) Some scholars believe that DIC patients, whose underlying diseases can be rapidly eliminated, such as pathological obstetrics and traumas, or those not suitable for anticoagulant treatment like heparin, can achieve effective DIC control through aggressive management of the primary disease and supplementation of platelets or coagulation factors. Main Preparations: (1) Fresh Whole Blood: Provides platelets and all coagulation factors except tissue factor. To rapidly correct the status of low platelets and coagulation factors in acute DIC, if the patient's cardiac function permits, a single blood transfusion of 800-1500 mL can be performed, or according to 20-30 mL/kg to increase platelet count to above 50×10^9/L and various coagulation factors to above 50%. To avoid triggering or exacerbating DIC by administrating platelets and coagulation factors, heparin 5-10 U per mL of blood (or other blood products) can be added during transfusion. Based on the author's over ten years of experience, this method can prevent DIC relapse without the risk of inducing bleeding complications. (2) Fresh Plasma: Except for red cells, everything is the same as in fresh whole blood, but the concentration of platelets, coagulation factors, etc., is approximately double. Plasma can reduce the total volume of liquid input for the patient, avoiding excessive cardiac load, and can also prevent the increase in blood viscosity and the unfavorable factors for DIC caused by a large influx of red cells and the release of membrane phospholipids due to red cell fragmentation. Some scholars have found that inputting 1000 mL of fresh plasma within 45 minutes can elevate the Factor VIII: C activity from 20% to 100% and fibrinogen to above 1.0 g/L, with the platelet count increasing to above 50×10^9/L. (3) Platelet Suspension: For DIC patients with platelet count lower than 20×10^9/L and suspected or severe cranial or visceral hemorrhage, emergency platelet suspension transfusion is required. Conventionally, the platelets separated from 500 mL of normal whole blood are termed as 1 U. The platelet transfusion dosage should aim to increase the patient's platelet count to above 50×10^9/L. To achieve this goal, platelet transfusion within 24 hours should not be less than 10 U, or according to 1 U per every 5 kg of body weight, or platelet 10 U/m² of body surface area. (4) Fibrinogen: For acute DIC patients with significant hypofibrinogenemia or severe bleeding, fibrinogen transfusion can be administered. The initial dosage is 2.0-4.0 g for intravenous drip, with subsequent dosages adjusted according to the clinical situation, aiming to raise plasma fibrinogen to above 1.0 g/L, with a total amount of 8.0-12.0 g within 24 hours. Since fibrinogen has a half-life of approximately 100 hours, in patients without significant fibrinolysis, additional use of this product is generally not required after 24 hours. (5) Factor VIII and Prothrombin Complex: Rarely required in DIC treatment practice, but occasionally indicated for severe liver disease and DIC patients. 4. Antifibrinolytic Agents Indications: According to modern views, these drugs should not be routinely used in DIC. Their main indications include: (1) DIC patients with clear clinical and experimental evidence of significant fibrinolysis, (2) Late-stage DIC, where secondary fibrinolysis has become the main cause of delayed bleeding. Main Preparations: (1) Aminocaproic Acid: 2.0-10.0 g/day, administered in divided doses for slow intravenous injection or infusion, use with caution in patients with shock. (2) Tranexamic Acid: 0.2-1.0 g/day, administered in divided doses for intravenous injection or infusion. (3) Epsilon Amino Caproic Acid: 0.5-2.0 g/day, administered in divided doses for intravenous injection or infusion. (4) Aprotinin: A broad-spectrum protease inhibitor, also inhibiting plasmin and Factor X activation, theoretically most suitable for DIC treatment due to its dual blockade of fibrinolysis and coagulation. The initial dose is 50,000 U, followed by a continuous intravenous drip of 10,000 U/h, or a total amount of 100,000-200,000 U/day, administered in divided doses for infusion. 5. Thrombolytic Therapy Indications: Due to secondary fibrinolysis being common in the mid to late stages of DIC, thrombolytic therapy is less frequently used, only in the following situations. (1) Prominent organ dysfunction that has not been effectively corrected by previous treatments. (2) End-stage DIC, where both coagulation and fibrinolysis processes have ceased, but organ function recovery is slow or poor. (3) Clear clinical and laboratory evidence of thromboembolism. Main Drugs: (1) Urokinase (UK): The commonly used dosage is an initial dose of 4000 U/kg for intravenous injection, followed by a continuous drip of 400 U/h. Due to its non-selective action, which can activate systemic fibrinolysis and degrade fibrinogen upon administration, this drug is currently less frequently used. In recent years, a single-chain urokinase has been developed abroad, whose activation of fibrinolysis relies on the presence of fibrin, showing stronger specificity, higher efficacy, and fewer adverse reactions. (2) Tissue Plasminogen Activator (t-PA): A highly efficient and specific plasminogen activator developed in recent years, possessing strong activation of plasminogen in the presence of fibrin. The commonly used dosage is 900,000-1,500,000 U, administered via intravenous injection within 30-60 minutes, or by continuous intravenous drip of 5000 U/(kg·h). (3) Anistreplase (APSAC): A new type of high-efficiency thrombolytic agent, lacking thrombolytic activity outside the body but, upon entering the bloodstream and binding with fibrin, undergoes deacylation hydrolysis, exposing the active center of plasminogen, activating thrombus plasminogen, and promoting fibrin degradation. Compared with streptokinase, urokinase, and recombinant t-PA, APSAC has a longer half-life, stronger affinity to fibrin, and fewer allergic reactions, making it an effective thrombolytic agent. There have been successful reports of its use in DIC thrombolytic therapy, with a dosage of 30 mg, administered via a Mofi tube drip, 2-3 times/day, for 3-5 consecutive days. 6. Other Treatment Measures (1) Corticosteroids: Not routinely recommended for DIC patients, but the following situations may warrant consideration: (1) Underlying diseases requiring corticosteroid treatment, such as various hypersensitivity diseases causing DIC, (2) Sepsis-induced shock complicated with DIC adopting strong anti-infection measures, (3) Concurrent adrenal cortex insufficiency. (2) Scopolamine: This drug can relieve vascular spasms, contributing to microcirculation improvement and shock correction. It can be pre-emptively used in the early and middle stages of DIC, with a dosage of 10-20 mg for intravenous injection or infusion, 2-3 times/day. 7. Efficacy Standards (1) Cure: (1) Underlying diseases and inducing factors have been removed or controlled, (2) DIC symptoms and signs have disappeared, (3) Laboratory indicators have returned to normal. (2) Improvement: Among the above 3 indicators, if 1 fails to meet the standard or 2 have not fully met the standard. (3) Ineffective: If the above indicators have not met the standard or the patient dies due to DIC. Prognosis According to statistics, the cure rate for DIC ranges from 50% to 80%, the improvement rate is 20% to 30%, and the mortality rate is 20% to 40%."
"Maculopapular rash, papules, wheals, itching, generalized erythematous patches, skin pruritus, crusting, desquamation",Caterpillar Dermatitis,"The treatment principles for Caterpillar Dermatitis focus on removing toxic hairs, relieving pain, reducing inflammation, and avoiding scratching. Topical treatments may include the application of traditional herbal plasters or adhesive tapes, and the use of clear tapes to adhere to the affected area to remove toxic hairs is recommended. Subsequently, a variety of anti-inflammatory and antipruritic agents can be applied, such as camphor, coal tar solution, freshly mashed Portulaca oleracea or Aloe vera (also known as dragon's tongue) mixed with realgar powder for external application. For severe itching, antihistamines may be administered. Oral intake of traditional Chinese medicine that clears heat and dampness can also be adjusted according to the patient's condition."
"Muscle pain, difficulty opening eyes, weakness",Congenital Myotonia,"What are the treatment methods for Congenital Myotonia? Treatment options primarily include pharmacotherapy similar to that for congenital myotonia. Medications demonstrating positive responses include local anesthetics and antiarrhythmic drugs, which mainly inhibit sodium channels. Mexiletine is the drug of choice, administered at a dosage of 100–300 mg, three times daily. Quinidine sulfate at 0.3–0.6 g, procainamide (procainamide) at 250–500 mg, once daily, all show definitive therapeutic effects. Tocainide at 1200 mg/day is effective but not recommended due to its potential to cause agranulocytosis. Phenytoin at 100 mg, three times daily, is effective in some cases. As for the prognosis, the condition is mostly non-progressive, with the situation tending to stabilize or improve after reaching adulthood."
"High fever, chills, cough, blood in sputum, chest pain",Pneumococcal Pneumonia,"For pneumococcal pneumonia strains that are sensitive to penicillin, Penicillin G is the preferred medication. For non-severe cases, oral administration of Penicillin G or V 250~500mg every 6 hours is recommended. For uncomplicated pneumococcal pneumonia, aqueous Penicillin G 0.5~2 million units IV injection every 4~6 hours is advised. 
Approximately 25% of pneumococcal strains are resistant to penicillin. In the United States, the rate of relative or high resistance among clinically isolated strains is 15%~30%, which is higher in other parts of the world, especially Spain, Japan, Israel, South Africa, and Western Europe. Many penicillin-resistant strains also show resistance to other antibiotics. Agar plates containing 1μg of benzylpenicillin are suitable for detecting resistant strains. Isolates with inhibition zones ≤19mm should be further tested using broth dilution methods. For highly resistant strains, treatment should be based on in vitro susceptibility tests. High doses of penicillin, cefotaxime or ceftriaxone are effective against most resistant strains. New-generation quinolones (levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, gatifloxacin, and trovafloxacin) are commonly chosen for penicillin-resistant strains and can also be alternative options for treatment of strains sensitive to penicillin. Vancomycin, as the only drug with a sustained activity, has antibacterial activity against all pneumococcal strains and should be the drug of choice for severely ill patients, particularly in cases where there is a high incidence of resistance to penicillin. 
Other effective drugs include cephalosporins, erythromycin, and clindamycin. Tetracycline is less reliable for pneumococcal coverage and should not be used in patients with severe conditions. Oral medications include erythromycin or clindamycin 300mg every 6 hours. Parenteral alternatives include cefotaxime 1~2g IV injection every 6 hours; ceftriaxone 1~2g IV injection every 12 hours; ceftazidime 500mg IV injection every 8 hours; erythromycin 0.5~1g IV injection every 6 hours; or clindamycin 300~600mg IV injection every 6~8 hours. Besides cefotaxime and ceftriaxone, most third-generation cephalosporins have relatively no antibacterial activity against pneumococci. 
In cases of suspected meningitis, patients should be given cefotaxime 2g IV injection every 4~6 hours or ceftriaxone 1~2g IV injection every 12 hours, along with vancomycin 1g IV injection every 12 hours, with or without rifampin 600mg/d orally, until susceptibility results are known. For patients with empyema, treatment should include appropriate drainage in addition to antibiotics. 
Supportive care includes bed rest, fluid supplementation, and analgesics for pleuritic pain. Patients with cyanosis, significant hypoxemia, severe respiratory distress, circulatory disturbance, or delirium should be given oxygen therapy. Continuous blood gas monitoring is essential, especially in patients with chronic lung diseases. 
It is generally recommended that patients over the age of 35 undergo follow-up chest X-rays. Chest radiographs may not show resolution of infiltrates until several weeks later, especially in severe cases, those with bacteremia, or patients with pre-existing chronic lung conditions. Persistence of infiltrates after 6 weeks or more of treatment suggests the possibility of an underlying primary bronchogenic carcinoma or TB."
"Milk secretion from the breasts outside of pregnancy or breastfeeding, menstrual irregularities",Prolactinoma,"The treatment for prolactinoma depends on the size of the tumor, the level of increased prolactin (PRL), symptoms, and fertility desires. 
1. Medical treatment: The first choice is bromocriptine, starting with 1.25 mg at bedtime. The dose is increased by 1.25-2.5 mg every 2-3 days, with an effective daily dose being 5-7.5 mg. After treatment, blood PRL levels decrease, and menstruation resumes in 2-3 months. Medication can be discontinued after about a year to observe for recurrence, although the rate of recurrence increases over time. 
2. Surgical treatment: Applicable to patients with giant adenomas that show no significant improvement after more than 3 months of bromocriptine treatment, and patients desiring fertility. However, surgical treatment is often not comprehensive, and postoperative treatment with bromocriptine is usually required. 
3. Radiation therapy: Can prevent recurrence after medication discontinuation to achieve long-term control. 
4. Management of prolactinomas during pregnancy: 
   a. The risk of prolactinomas increasing in size during pregnancy is very small. 
   b. Bromocriptine should be discontinued immediately upon conception. 
   c. In cases where the tumor is >10mm, a visual field check should be performed every 4-6 weeks. If headaches or a reduction in the visual field occurs, induction of labor might be needed. If postponement of delivery is necessary, bromocriptine should be continued to reduce the tumor size. 
   d. Bromocriptine should generally be discontinued 24 hours postpartum. Breastfeeding is not recommended. 
   e. Patients using bromocriptine in the postpartum period should be aware of the effects of contraceptives. If contraception is needed, estrogen-based contraceptives should be avoided."
"Often asymptomatic, presenting with pale yellow pubic hair, vulva and labia majora skin turning milky white or pink, while the labia minora and vaginal mucosa appear bright red.",Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus,"What are the treatment options for Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus? What are the considerations before treatment? 

Prevention: Avoiding consanguineous marriage is crucial. Protection against OCA is important, including wearing protective eyewear. 

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Treatment: 

Vulvar white lesion disease, also known as chronic vulvar malnutrition, refers to a group of diseases caused by nutritional disorders in the skin and mucosa of the female genitalia, leading to tissue degeneration and pigment changes. The disease is often related to neurovascular nutritional imbalance in the deep connective tissue of the vulva, causing pathological changes in the overlying skin. 

TCM categorizes the disease based on its pathological characteristics and clinical symptoms, treating it as ""vaginal itching"" or ""vaginal sores"" determined by conditions such as itching with wind or sores with damp-heat. The disease is common in women of reproductive and older age, and rare in young girls. 

Generally, there are two types: 1) Hypertrophic malnutrition, characterized by unbearable itching of the vulva, pain after scratching, affecting the labia majora and the groove between the labia, usually symmetrical, with thickened skin resembling leather, raised with wrinkles, generally without atrophy and adhesion. 

2) Sclerotic lichenoid malnutrition, characterized by itchy lesions, whitening and thinning of the skin or mucosa, which becomes dry and easily cracked, losing elasticity, often with clitoral atrophy. Difficulties in sexual intercourse may occur in the late stage. 

Diagnosis should exclude external pruritus caused by diabetes, fungi, etc. Consider pathological examination when there are ulcers and significant hyperplasia to prevent malignant transformation. Overall assessment includes body weight, strength, sensation of cold, heat, alternating chills and fever, cold limbs. Examination of the tongue, identification of the tongue coat, pulse reading, detailed inquiry into menstruation, vaginal discharge, pregnancy, childbirth, and if siblings have the disease. 

Locally, inspect the lesion for cracks, atrophy, ulcers, hardening, adhesion, swelling, exudation, desquamation, reduced elasticity. Check if the edges of the skin lesions are neat and the boundaries clear. Observe the rash's morphology to differentiate between damp-cold, heat accumulation, yang deficiency, phlegm stasis, qi-blood deficiency, and to assess the disease's progression. Vulvar white lesions are closely related to the liver and kidney meridians, according to ""Nei Jing"" stating ""the kidney opens up to the two yins"" and ""the liver meridian connects to the genitals."" The main causes and mechanisms of vulvar white lesions include deficiency in kidney essence and liver blood, leading to a lack of nourishment to the vulva, coupled with attacks by external pathological wind or damp-heat stagnation. Although the disease manifests externally on the vulva, it is related to liver depression, spleen deficiency, kidney deficiency, disharmony of the Chong and Ren meridians, triggered by damp-cold, heat, yang deficiency, and phlegm stasis. 

Western Medicine Treatment: 

Currently, there is no effective cure. Treatments are symptomatic, including avoiding sunlight, using sunblock, regular health check-ups, and early detection and treatment of skin malignancies."
"Limb pain, numbness, sensory and functional disorders",Meralgia Paresthetica,"Upon a confirmed diagnosis of Meralgia Paresthetica, treatment options vary depending on the underlying cause. For cases caused by local scar proliferation or fascial compartment syndrome, conservative treatment options, including rest and physiotherapy, are recommended. If these methods prove ineffective, surgical exploration may be performed to remove the compressive factors, including releasing the fascial compartment and excising perineural scar tissue. For patients with nerve deformation due to compression, palpable hardness, or severe pain symptoms, neurolysis surgery should be considered."
"Fever, malaise, anemia, toothache, alveolar swelling, tooth mobility, pain, swelling of the cheek soft tissue, thickening of the mandible",Actinomycosis,"The treatment of actinomycosis can be challenging. This is due to the difficulty in making an early diagnosis for certain locations of the infection, such as in the thoracic and abdominal regions or within the spinal column, which results in delayed treatment and generally poor prognosis. 

Surgical intervention is commonly employed, involving incision and drainage as well as the excision of necrotic tissue. The aim is to expose the infected site to air as much as possible. High doses of antibiotics are administered before and after the surgery, with penicillin being the drug of choice. Daily doses range from 2 to 6 million units, continuing for several months. In some cases, sulfonamides and iodides may also be used. Supportive care is provided for patients in poor general health. Radiation therapy may be used for infections in the facial and neck areas. 

Attention to oral hygiene and infection prevention is crucial. Post-extraction antibiotics, for example, play a significant role in preventing the occurrence of actinomycosis."
"Vulvar itching, dry skin, whitening, loss of elasticity, erosions, pain and burning sensation, vulvar atrophy",Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus,"Treatment modalities for Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus include: 

1. Pharmacological treatment: Post washing the vulva with a pH4 acidulated feminine wash, treatments include topical application and local injection of ste**id medications, anaerobic bacillus treatment, and traditional Chinese medicinal treatments. 

2. Physical therapy: Microwave therapy, Carbon dioxide laser and Helium-Neon laser treatment, Bome light, high-frequency electrosurgical excision, local electric cauterization, and cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen. 

3. Surgical treatment: Simple vulvectomy and vulvectomy with skin grafting. 

4. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment utilizes a holistic approach to balance and nutrition with penetration therapy. This method is side-effect-free, focuses on specific targets with high efficacy, and contains multiple active and repairing factors. Its unique high-strength penetration can swiftly reach the lesion site within the body, causing irreversible coagulative necrosis in the affected tissue while sparing the surrounding tissues unharmed. This method does not affect future fertility, education or work, establishing an innovative clinical effect of ‘eliminating the lesion without damaging the tissues’. 

General Management Guidelines: 

Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus requires long-term treatment. The affected vulvar skin may thicken resembling leather or become thin and dry to the point of cracking, and in some cases, ulcers and hardening may occur. The vulvar skin becomes whitened, and irrespective of the presence of itching, a medical examination is advisable. Areas with thickened, coarse, elevated skin, ulcers, cracks, and hardening warrant caution; surgery may be necessary in some cases. The slow progression of vulvar lichen sclerosus has previously led to surgical excision due to the risk of malignancy, but surgery is no longer the advocated treatment. In advanced cases, the vaginal opening may contract and narrow, and the vulva can atrophy with the clitoris shrinking and surrounding tissues losing elasticity. Given the stubborn nature of Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus, patients are advised to adhere to long-term treatment and regular follow-ups, preferably every 3 to 6 months, to achieve satisfactory outcomes eventually. 

Patients typically experience persistent itching that can last from months to as long as 20 years, an incessant sensation that does not vary with seasons or time of the day, becoming unbearable. Accompanying tr**homoniasis or candida vaginitis may exacerbate the itching. Due to the unidentified cause, there is no specific treatment, but laser therapy or topical application of 2% testosterone propionate in cod liver oil ointment can be attempted. Regular hygiene and dryness, avoiding soaps or irritant substances for cleaning the vulva, and refraining from eating spicy or irritating foods are recommended. Loose clothing, frequent change of garments, and the use of soft cotton materials are advised. 

From a Traditional Chinese Medicine perspective, this condition is related to malnutrition, tissue degeneration, and pigment alterations in the female genital skin and mucosa, often linked to dysregulation of nerve and vascular nutrition in the deep connective tissue of the vulva. TCM treatment varies based on the characteristics and clinical symptoms of the condition, with strategies targeting ‘vulvar itching’ and ‘vulvar sores’. The condition, which is more prevalent among women in their reproductive and older years, with less incidence in young girls, can be effectively managed with TCM's nutritional balance and penetration therapy tailored to the individual’s condition, type, and constitution. TCM attributes vulvar itching to liver channel wind-heat or spleen deficiency harboring heat, suggesting that kidney deficiency failing to moisten the genitalia and wind pathogens entering the skin can cause itching and sores. TCM also holds that insufficient essence and blood, deficiencies in the Conception Vessel, and atrophy of the genitalia are key to the nutritional disturbances leading to this condition. Thus, TCM’s principle of balancing and nutritionally penetrating therapy aims at a comprehensive treatment covering itching relief, inflammation reduction, and skin nourishment, targeting the symptoms, the inducing factors, and fundamentally nourishing the vulva."
"Snoring during sleep, sleepiness, irritability, headache",Sleep Apnea Syndrome,"The treatment approaches for Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS) can be broadly categorized into non-surgical and surgical treatments apart from lifestyle changes like cessation of smoking and alcohol, weight loss, and dietary control. 
Non-surgical treatments include: 
1. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy, which functions as an airway splint to prevent the passive collapse of soft tissues during inhalation and stimulates mechanoreceptors in the genioglossus muscle, thereby increasing airway tension. It can be used as a standalone therapy or in conjunction with surgical treatments, although long-term adherence can be challenging for patients. In countries like the United States, the majority of patients achieve satisfactory outcomes with CPAP, in contrast to domestic practices where surgery is often the prevalent treatment modality due to differences in awareness. 
2. Various orthotic devices. Using specialized orthotic devices during sleep to elevate the soft palate, actively or passively pull the tongue forward, and advance the mandible can enlarge the oropharynx and hypopharynx to improve breathing. This is one of the main non-surgical treatments for snoring and an important adjunct for non-surgical management of OSAHS, but it is ineffective for severe cases. 
3. Oxygen therapy and various pharmacological treatments such as neuro-respiratory stimulants are also supportive treatment options. 
Surgical treatments: 
Surgery is a fundamental approach to addressing OSAHS, aiming to alleviate and eliminate airway obstruction and prevent the collapse of the airway's soft tissues. The choice of surgical method depends on the site of airway obstruction, severity of the condition, presence of pathological obesity, and the overall health of the patient. Common surgical techniques include: 
1. Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, primarily for children with tonsil and adenoid hypertrophy before puberty. 
2. Nasal surgery for those with blocked nasal airways due to deviated nasal septum, nasal polyps, or hypertrophy of the turbinates, including septoplasty and removal of nasal polyps or turbinates to alleviate symptoms. 
3. Tongue reduction surgery for individuals with macroglossia, posterior displacement of the tongue, or enlarged lingual tonsils. 
4. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), which involves removing the redundant tissue of the uvula and posterior edge of the soft palate as well as tightening and suturing the mucous membrane of the pharyngeal side walls to relieve airway obstruction at the level of the soft palate and oropharynx but not the hypopharynx. Proper patient selection is crucial for this procedure. 
5. Orthognathic surgery, which has grown increasingly sophisticated since the 1970s for treating maxillofacial deformities and is an effective method for managing OSAHS caused by jawbone deformities obstructing the oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal airways."
"Fever, chronic cough, expectoration and hemoptysis, stomach pain, diarrhea, oral mucosa, tongue and palate cheesy patch curd-like white pseudomembrane, erythematous base with a burning sensation in the pharynx and larynx and at their junction, skin erythema and exudation, skin fold candidiasis, tumoral nodular, granuloma, itching, edema, erythema, epithelial peeling, and scabbing",Actinomycosis,"Treatment options for actinomycosis include: 

1. Iodides: Iodides are effective for bronchial, pulmonary, and cutaneous actinomycosis. The usual dosage is 6g daily, often continued for 4 to 6 months. The method of administration involves dissolving 20g of potassium iodide in 300ml of water, making each 15ml of the solution contain 1g of potassium iodide. This medication is generally tolerable, with gastritis being the main side effect, which can be prevented by taking with milk or orange juice. If needed, daily intramuscular or intravenous injections of 1 to 2g of potassium iodide can be administered. Other side effects include rash, nodular erythema, and hyperthyroidism. For immunocompromised patients, azole drugs such as itraconazole or ketoconazole are recommended. 

2. Amphotericin B: This polyene antibiotic is very effective against Candida albicans and Actinomyces. For pulmonary and bronchial actinomycosis, inhale 1.5 million units of amphotericin B in polyethylene glycol as a mist. It is recommended to use the inhalation in the evening; for gastrointestinal and oral actinomycosis, amphotericin B can be taken orally or applied topically. 

3. Gentian violet: 30mg capsules of gentian violet, each coated with ethylsuccinate, can be used daily, with three capsules a day. For oral and cutaneous actinomycosis, a 0.1% gentian violet solution in 15% ethanol can be applied externally 2 to 3 times a day. 

4. Azole drugs: Suitable for pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and cutaneous actinomycosis. Ketoconazole is administered at a dose of 400mg daily, and itraconazole is used in a dosage range of 100 to 400mg daily; they can also be used in conjunction with amphotericin B or potassium iodide. 

5. Aluminum acetate solution: A 5% solution of aluminum acetate can be used to wash the external ear canal for otic actinomycosis. Afterwards, amphotericin B or clotrimazole should be applied. 

6. Amphotericin B: This drug is ineffective against any form of actinomycosis."
"Oily and glossy skin, itching, erythema, or white scales peeling and regenerating",Seborrheic Dermatitis,"What are the treatment methods for Seborrheic Dermatitis? 

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Treatment: 

1. For the scalp, apply Seborrheic Dermatitis tincture or Platycladus orientalis tincture topically, three times a day.

2. For the face, use acne wash or Dian Dao San wash solution for external application, twice a day.

3. For wet type and pityriasis rosea type, apply Indigo Naturalis ointment followed by San Shi Powder.

4. For those with a lot of scales and itching, use Seborrheic Dermatitis wash prescription, decoct and warmly wash the affected area once or twice a day, for 10 to 15 minutes each time.

5. For those without erosion and exudation, external application of Sophora flavescens alcohol solution or Mo Feng ointment can be used.

6. For those with a lot of crusts, apply 5% sulfur ointment topically, two to three times a day.

7. For those with excessive oiliness, use 30g of Herba Siegesbeckiae, 60g of Acacia catechu and 60g of Platycladus orientalis leaves decocted in water for external washing, once every three days.

8. For those with excessive dandruff or dry skin lesions, use 60g of Xanthium sibiricum, 30g of Fructus Xanthii, and 9g of Alum decocted in water for hair washing."
"Itchy eyes, eyelid swelling, conjunctival edema, blurred vision, tearing, pain",Allergic Rhinitis,"Treatment options for allergic rhinitis include: 
Western medicine treatments: 
1. Specific immunotherapy using pollen antigen extracts (desensitization treatment) is an effective measure for treating allergic rhinitis. With an effectiveness rate of 85%～95%, options include rapid desensitization, preseason and midseason desensitization, and sublingual or oral desensitization treatments. 
2. Local injection of corticosteroid muscle relaxants or acupoint blockage, administered once before or during the pollen season, can prevent the onset of symptoms. 
3. The application of glucocorticoid nasal sprays is currently the best recommended treatment for allergic rhinitis. In cases of conjunctival allergic inflammation, antihistamine therapy should be added. 
4. Antihistamines remain the most commonly used symptomatic treatment during the pollen season. 
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatments: 
1. For Lung Qi deficiency: Warm the lungs and augment Qi, dispel wind and dispel cold. Prescription example includes modifications to Wen Fei Zhi Liu Dan with ingredients such as Ginseng, Schizonepeta, Asarum, Chebula, Saposhnikovia, Platycodon, Astragalus, Schisandra, Atractylodes, Houttuynia, Licorice. 
2. For Lung and Spleen Qi deficiency: Strengthen the spleen and augment Qi, nourish the lungs and consolidate Qi. Prescription example includes modifications to Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with ingredients such as Astragalus, Processed Licorice, Ginseng, Angelica, Tangerine Peel, Cimicifuga, Bupleurum, Atractylodes.

Other therapies: Nasal drops, blowing medicine into the nose, nose ointments, acupoint application, and Chinese patent medicines are used according to the specific TCM diagnosis and symptoms presented by the patient. 
Combined traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatment: Recent studies have combined traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine to treat allergic rhinitis, harnessing the strengths of both systems to improve overall treatment efficacy. While the rapid symptomatic relief provided by Western medicine is undeniable, TCM plays a significant role in stabilizing treatment effects and avoiding some side effects associated with Western medications, especially for patients with contraindications to certain drugs like steroids. Incorporating TCM's holistic approaches, including Qi regulation and meridian harmonization, into allergic rhinitis treatment has shown promising results in comprehensive therapy."
"Headache, apathetic facial expression, urinary and fecal incontinence, visual impairments, decreased appetite, nausea and vomiting, muscle soreness, coma, fever, papular rash, chest pain",Gnathostomiasis,"The treatment for Gnathostomiasis involves several approaches: 
1. General Treatment: Patients should rest in bed and consume a bland, easily digestible diet. Intravenous fluids may be administered as necessary to replenish vitamins, electrolytes, and glucose. Enhanced care is crucial for patients in a coma to prevent pressure ulcers and aspiration pneumonia. 
2. Symptomatic Treatment: Concurrent use of corticosteroids during etiological treatment significantly reduces adverse reactions caused by therapeutic drugs, such as severe headaches, projectile vomiting, and major epileptic seizures. Dexamethasone is commonly used, starting at 10mg/day for 3-5 days, then reduced to 5mg/day, gradually tapering off based on the therapeutic response, with a total treatment duration of 8-20 days. In cases of intracranial hypertension symptoms (restlessness, severe headache, projectile vomiting, increased blood pressure, bradycardia, unequal pupil size, slow reaction to light), timely administration of 20% Mannitol solution is necessary, dosed at 1-2 g/kg, administered intravenously. This may be repeated after 4-8 hours if necessary, to reduce intracranial pressure and prevent herniation. 
3. Etiological Treatment: Albendazole is effective against this disease. The dosage for adults is 40mg/day for 6-10 days. The dosage for children should be appropriately reduced. To mitigate potential adverse reactions during treatment, some advocate starting with 200 mg/day for 3-5 days, then increasing to 400mg/day for an additional 5-7 days, with a total treatment duration of 10 days. Animal studies have shown that treatment with Flubendazole or Parbendazole can also be effective. However, treatments with Thiabendazole, Mebendazole, and Levamisole have been found less effective. Ivermectin, a broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent, demonstrates potent activity against a variety of nematodes, including Ascaris, Trichuris, Ancylostoma, Brugia malayi, Wuchereria bancrofti, and Onchocerca, and may also be effective against this disease. 
4. Treatment of Complications and Concomitant Disorders: Complications such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome, cerebral nerve damage, limb paralysis, and hydrocephalus may occur, as well as concurrent bacterial and fungal infections. These conditions should be addressed accordingly."
"Breast lumps, pain",Mastitis,"What are the treatment methods for mastitis? 
Precautions before treating mastitis include: 
[Prevention and Regulation] 
1. Actively treat primary diseases. For those caused by tumors, tumor resection should be carried out; for drug-induced cases, related drugs should be discontinued; for those caused by liver disease, hepatoprotective drugs should be used. 
2. Regulate emotional state to maintain a cheerful mood. 
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment methods for mastitis include: 
Internal treatment methods: 
(a) For liver Qi stagnation presenting as painful swelling and lumps in the areola, accompanied by irritability, anger at trivial things, chest discomfort, a slightly red tongue, thin white coating, and taut pulse, the diagnosis and treatment involve liver Qi stagnation transforming into fire, condensing fluids into phlegm, and resulting in an interlocking of phlegm and Qi, thus causing the areola lumps and swelling. The liver depression causes irritability and chest discomfort. Taut pulse is indicative of liver depression, and a red tongue signifies Qi stagnation transforming into fire. The treatment principle is to soothe the liver, regulate Qi, transform phlegm, and dissolve lumps. The prescription used is a modification of Xiao Yao San combined with Er Chen Tang. 
(b) For kidney Qi deficiency, common in middle-aged and elderly people, presenting as breast enlargement, formation of nodules in the breast, and mild breast pain. Those with kidney yang deficiency may demonstrate a pale complexion, weakness in the lower back and legs, lethargy, cold limbs, a pale tongue, white coating, and a slow weak pulse; whereas those with kidney yin deficiency may experience a dark complexion, irritability, insomnia, soreness of waist and knees, a red tongue, scanty coating, taut and thin pulse. The diagnosis involves kidney Qi deficiency leading to dysfunction of Chong and Ren meridians, liver not being nourished, Qi stagnation and phlegm condensation, causing nodules in the breast channels, hence the breast enlargement, nodules, and pain; kidney yang deficiency results in cold due to yang deficiency, hence cold limbs; a pale complexion and weak pulse are indicators of kidney yang deficiency; kidney yin deficiency leads to insufficient nourishment of heart fire, hence irritability and insomnia; since the disease is in the kidney, symptoms include soreness of waist and knees, and a dark complexion; red tongue, scanty coating, and taut and thin pulse are indicative of liver and kidney yin deficiency. The treatment principle is to nourish the liver and kidney, transform phlegm, and soften lumps. The prescription for kidney yang deficiency is adjusted with You Gui Wan to warm yang and transform phlegm; for kidney yin deficiency, Zuo Gui Wan is used to nourish yin and transform phlegm."
"Itching or intense itching of the nipple, burning sensation, followed by redness of the nipple and areola skin, presence of yellowish-brown scaly crusts, revealing slight skin erosion under the crust, presenting as chronic eczematous changes.",Paget's Disease of the Breast,"What are the treatment options for Paget's Disease of the Breast?
Prevention:
Firstly, a healthy lifestyle and exercise are essential. A study by Harvard University indicates that women who gain 20 to 25 kilograms after the age of 18, and entering menopause, have twice the likelihood of developing breast cancer compared to those who only gained a few kilograms. Thus, it's crucial for women to control their weight from a young age. Additionally, minimizing alcohol consumption and smoking, along with timely supplementation of Vitamin D are effective secrets in preventing breast cancer. Women around menopause who exercise regularly can reduce their chances of breast cancer by 60%. The weekly exercise time should be no less than 4 hours, including walking, weightlifting, or other physical labors that involve hands and arms.
Secondly, monthly self-examinations. Due to the lack of specific conscious symptoms, many women are unaware of early breast cancer. By the time symptoms like small lumps in the breast are noticed, the cancer may be in its middle or advanced stages; hence, self-examination is very important. The simplest method is to conduct a self-examination once a month, paying attention to whether the breasts are symmetric, the presence of small nodules, and any change in the skin or position of the breasts. If suspicious changes are found, it's important to seek specialized medical examination timely.
Thirdly, regular specialized check-ups at hospitals. Experts recommend that women over 35 should undergo an annual breast ultrasound examination, with a diagnostic rate of up to 85%; for those over 40, it is advised to include mammography in health examinations. Upon diagnosis, it is crucial to undergo a HER2 positive test in the pathology department to rule out the most malignant and highest mortality type among all breast cancers, HER2 positive breast cancer. Prof. Sun Qiang from Peking Union Medical College Hospital pointed out that many patients and doctors, due to insufficient knowledge about HER2 positive breast cancer, may experience incomplete examinations leading to delayed treatment and ultimately regrettable tragedies.
Preoperative preparation:
1) Psychological preparation: The attending physician should thoroughly discuss the diagnosis of the disease, surgical methods, potential complications, and preventive measures, and clearly explain the necessity of surgery, potential outcomes, risks, complications, recovery process, and prognosis to the patient and their family to gain their trust and cooperation. Patients and their families should also ask the attending physician about their concerns regarding breast cancer surgery and prognosis without reservation, and receive clear explanations to be fully psychologically prepared.
2) Physical preparation: This involves preparing the patient's physiological state to safely undergo surgery in optimal condition.
a) Exercises adapted for postoperative changes: Many patients are not used to urinating or defecating in bed, and should practice before surgery. Patients often avoid coughing due to incisional pain after surgery, so they should be taught the correct coughing and expectoration techniques before surgery. Patients with a smoking habit should quit smoking 2 weeks prior to surgery.
b) Before major breast cancer surgery, blood type testing and cross-matching tests should be done, and a sufficient amount of whole blood should be prepared.
c) Various measures should be taken to prevent infection before surgery. Improve the patient's physique, strictly adhere to aseptic principles, perform surgery gently, and prophylactic antibiotics can be used before major breast cancer surgery.
d) It is not necessary to restrict diet before breast cancer surgery, but fasting should begin 12 hours before surgery and no drinking 4 hours before surgery to prevent choking or aspiration pneumonia due to vomiting during anesthesia or surgery. If necessary, gastrointestinal decompression can be applied. A soap water enema should be given the day before surgery.
e) Ideally, about a week before major breast cancer surgery, provide the patient with sufficient calories, proteins, and vitamins through oral, injection, or intravenous high-nutrition methods.
f) Other preparations: If the patient has a fever or menstrual period, the surgery date should be delayed. A sedative can be given the night before surgery to ensure adequate sleep. The patient should empty their bladder before entering the operating room, and a catheter may be placed for surgeries estimated to be long. Additionally, any removable dental prostheses should be removed to prevent them from falling or being swallowed during anesthesia or surgery."
"Sensory disturbances, dysarthria, breathing difficulties, muscle atrophy, hyperactive tendon reflexes, paralysis, choking cough, and pathological laughter/crying",Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS),"The treatment options for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) include: 
1. Riluzole may reduce the release of glutamate in the central nervous system, decreasing excitotoxicity, postponing the time to respiratory dysfunction, and extending survival time in ALS patients. However, it does not improve motor functions or muscle strength. It is suitable for mild to moderate patients but is relatively expensive. The adult dosage is 50 mg orally, twice a day. Side effects include fatigue, nausea, weight loss, and increased transaminases. 

2. Vitamin E may benefit ALS patients, with many undergoing empirical treatment with it. Various neurotrophic factor therapy trials are underway, and stem cell therapy experiments and clinical research for ALS are in exploratory stages. 

3. Symptomatic treatments like anticholinergic drugs such as scopolamine, atropine, and glycopyrrolate for excessive salivation; diazepam, baclofen, and clonazepam for muscle spasms; are recommended. It is important to actively prevent pulmonary infections. Using supports or walkers can enhance patients' mobility. Passive exercise and physical therapy can prevent contractures. 

4. Supportive care is crucial for ensuring adequate nutrition and improving overall condition. For those with severe swallowing difficulties, semi-liquid diets, nasogastric tube feeding, or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy may be needed to maintain normal nutrition and hydration. Respiratory support can extend life when breathing difficulties arise. For patients with milder symptoms, non-invasive ventilation can relieve hypercapnia and hypoxemia. In late stages, tracheostomy may be necessary for maintaining ventilation. Newly invented respiratory devices that can produce artificial coughs are highly beneficial for clearing airways and preventing aspiration pneumonia."
"Hemiplegia (paralysis of one side of the body), unilateral limb disorder, numbness in limbs, hemianopia, aphasia",Post-stroke Sequelae,"Various treatment modalities for post-stroke sequelae include: 
Principles of treatment involve improving symptoms of post-stroke sequelae, effectively reducing the high recurrence rate through a combination of scientific diet, active and passive rehabilitation exercises, alongside reliable pharmacotherapy. Treatment targets arteriosclerotic plaque formation due to stroke causation, high blood viscosity, and other basic lesions, to prevent the formation of arteriosclerotic thrombosis; improve the supply and oxygenation of brain tissue, creating a favorable internal environment for the brain, and recovering the brain nervous system, thus improving the motor and language neurological signs controlled by it. Fundamentally enhancing the conditions of aphasia and physical disability caused by stroke and effectively preventing disease recurrence and progression. 
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Treatment includes: 
1) Activating blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis, which is widely applied clinically, inhibiting arteriosclerosis and thrombosis, increasing brain blood flow, aiding in the absorption of perilesional hemorrhage and edema, and improving clinical symptoms. Not suitable for acute-phase treatment. 
2) Aromatic resuscitation therapy, which opens orifices and is capable of dredging meridians, regulating qi and activating blood. It has shown significant effects in treating headache and limb pain caused by cerebrovascular obstruction. Through the blood-brain barrier directly to the lesion, it works quickly with definitive efficacy. 
3) Combined therapy of activating blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis and aromatic resuscitation, using TCM that can act on both blood and vascular lesions of stroke, combining hundreds of effective ingredients from animals, plants, and aromatics. This strategy achieves synergistic effects, enhancing efficacy, reducing toxicity, and combating drug resistance. It inhibits platelet aggregation, has a high efficiency in anticoagulation, lowers blood plasma viscosity, and plasma lipid peroxides, making it difficult for lipid substances in the blood to accumulate in arteries and form thrombi. Moreover, it can accelerate the clearance of blood oxygen free radicals, effectively remove lipid substances formed on the arterial wall, prevent arteriosclerosis, create a favorable internal environment for brain tissue, increase arterial blood flow, enhance the brain's hypoxia tolerance, protect vascular endothelial cells from damage, prevent thrombosis formation, recover the brain nervous system, and improve motor and language neurological signs, aiming to treat cerebral infarction effectively. 
Western medical treatment targets are more singular, and most Western medicines, including aspirin, have varying degrees of drug resistance, with significant side effects that can damage the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys to different extents. Hence, Western medicine is mainly used during acute stroke episodes but not recommended for long-term use in recovery and secondary prevention phases. 
Rehabilitative Therapy aims to improve symptoms like dizziness, headache, numbness in limbs, and language difficulties to the best state possible and to reduce the high recurrence rate of stroke. Currently, it’s believed that patients with mobility disorders due to stroke can significantly reduce or alleviate paralysis sequelae through proper rehabilitation training. Rehabilitation training should begin as early and actively as possible. Improper strength training can exacerbate spasticity, while appropriate rehabilitation training can alleviate it, making limb movements more coordinated. Establishing a routine for daily life training and adjusting to reality and emotions are essential aspects for facilitating functional recovery from post-stroke sequelae."
"Headache, vomiting, gait instability, inability to stand steady, epileptic seizures",Glioma,"What are the treatment methods for gliomas? 

The primary treatment for gliomas is surgical removal. However, due to the infiltrative growth of the tumor and the lack of a clear boundary between the tumor and brain tissue, complete removal is difficult except in cases where the tumor is small and located in an appropriate area at an early stage. A comprehensive treatment approach is advocated, which involves radiation therapy and chemotherapy following surgery to delay relapse and extend survival. Early diagnosis and timely treatment are crucial to improving treatment outcomes. Surgery in advanced stages not only poses greater risks but also often results in neurological deficits. High-grade tumors, in particular, tend to recur within a short period. 

Surgical treatment aims to remove the tumor as much as possible while preserving neurological function. For early-stage, small tumors, total resection should be attempted. For superficial tumors, an incision is made around the tumor in the cortex, and for white matter tumors, it is important to avoid important functional areas. When separating the tumor, it is advisable to maintain a certain distance from the tumor and operate within normal brain tissue rather than closely following the tumor. Especially in the frontal or temporal lobes or cerebellar hemispheres, better therapeutic effects can be achieved for relatively benign tumors such as astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. 

For larger tumors located in the frontal or temporal lobes, lobectomy can be performed to remove the tumor. The incision for frontal lobe tumors should be at least 2 cm in front of the precentral sulcus, avoiding the motor speech center in the dominant hemisphere. For temporal lobe tumors, the incision should be in front of the inferior anastomotic vein and avoid damaging the lateral fissure vessels. Some occipital lobe tumors may also be suitable for lobectomy, though this may result in homonymous hemianopia. If it is not possible to completely remove a widespread frontal or temporal lobe tumor, as much of the tumor as possible should be removed along with decompression surgery at the frontal pole to prolong the recurrence time. 

Tumors affecting more than two lobes of the cerebral hemisphere with hemiplegia but not invading the basal ganglia, thalamus, or the contralateral side may undergo hemispherectomy. 

In cases where the tumor is located in the motor or speech areas without significant hemiplegia or aphasia, care should be taken to preserve neurological function and avoid severe sequelae. Temporalis muscle undercutting or bone flap decompression may be performed simultaneously. A biopsy followed by decompression surgery may also be appropriate. For thalamic tumors causing obstruction of the third ventricle, a shunt procedure may be performed, otherwise decompression surgery is an option. 

Ventricular tumors can be accessed and resected through non-essential functional areas of the brain tissue to relieve ventricular obstruction. Care should be taken to avoid damaging the hypothalamus or brainstem adjacent to the tumor to prevent risk. Small nodular or cystic brainstem tumors can be resected, while those with increased intracranial pressure may undergo shunt surgery. Tumors in the superior vermis that are difficult to resect may also be treated with shunt surgery. 

In urgent cases, tumors above the tentorium should be treated with diuretics while actively diagnosing and preparing for surgery. Posterior fossa tumors may first undergo ventricular drainage surgery, followed by surgical treatment after 2-3 days once the condition has stabilized. 

Radiation therapy: External radiation sources include high-voltage X-ray therapy machines, 60Co therapy machines, and electron accelerators. The latter two use high-energy rays with strong penetration, low skin dose, and minimal bone absorption. Accelerators concentrate the dose at the predicted depth, with a sharp drop beyond this depth, protecting normal brain tissue behind the lesion. Radiation therapy should begin as soon as possible after surgery once the general condition has recovered. The usual dose for gliomas is 5000-6000cGy, completed within 5-6 weeks. For tumors with large radiation fields and high radiosensitivity, such as medulloblastomas, a dose of 4000-5000cGy may be given. 

The sensitivity of various types of gliomas to radiation therapy varies. Poorly differentiated tumors are considered to have higher sensitivity than well-differentiated ones. Medulloblastomas are most sensitive to radiation therapy, followed by ependymomas, with polymorphic glioblastomas being moderately sensitive, and astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and pineocytomas being less sensitive. For medulloblastomas and ependymomas that tend to spread through cerebrospinal fluid, full spinal canal irradiation should be included. 

Chemotherapy: Highly lipophilic chemotherapy drugs that can cross the blood-brain barrier are suitable for treating brain gliomas. In grade III-IV astrocytomas, the blood-brain barrier is breached due to edema, allowing large water-soluble molecules to pass; therefore, it is considered that the choice of drugs can be expanded to many water-soluble molecules. However, in areas surrounding the tumor where proliferating cells are dense, the disruption of the blood-brain barrier is not severe. Therefore, the choice of drugs should still primarily be lipophilic ones. The following drugs are currently recommended as first choices. 

1. Teniposide: Chemically known as 4'-demethyl-epipodophyllotoxin β-D-ethylidene glucoside, trade name Vumon (teniposide, VM26), is a semi-synthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin. With a molecular weight of 656.7, it has a broad anti-tumor spectrum, high lipophilicity, and can cross the blood-brain barrier. It is a cell-cycle-specific drug that damages deoxyribonucleic acid and blocks G2 (late DNA synthesis) and M (mitosis) phases. VM26's toxicity to tumor cells ranges from 70% to 98%, while its toxicity to normal cells is only 28% to 38%. The usual dosage for adults is 120-200mg/m2 per day for 2-6 days. When combined with CCNU, the dose can be reduced to 60mg/m2 per day, infused in 250ml of 10% glucose solution over approximately one and a half hours for 2 days, followed by oral CCNU on the 3rd and 4th days, with the four days constituting one course of treatment. Treatment cycles are repeated every 6 weeks. Side effects: Mild myelosuppression and low toxicity; cardiovascular reactions manifest as hypotension, hence blood pressure should be monitored during intravenous drip. 

2. Lomustine (CCNU): Has been in clinical use for many years and affects proliferating cells at all stages of the cell cycle, including the resting phase. Its strong lipophilicity allows it to cross the blood-brain barrier, making it suitable for treating malignant gliomas. The main toxic reactions are delayed bone marrow suppression and cumulative effects, significantly limiting its use. After 4-5 courses, a marked reduction in white blood cells and platelets necessitates a delay or even interruption of treatment, leading to relapse. Severe gastrointestinal reactions are also common, with a high percentage of patients experiencing nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain after taking the drug. The liver and lungs are also affected. The usual dosage for adults is 100-130mg/m2 per day orally for 1-2 days, repeated every 4-6 days. When combined with VM26, the dose can be reduced to 60mg/m2 per day. 

3. Semustine (MeCCNU): Dosage is 170-225mg/m2. The administration method is the same as CCNU, but the toxicity is lower. 

The trend in chemotherapy for gliomas is towards combination therapy. Based on cell kinetics and the specificity of drugs for cell cycles, two or more drugs are combined, or even multiple drugs are used together, to improve efficacy. Shanghai Zhang Tianxi's sequential chemotherapy using teniposide-lomustine has shown significant effects and is recommended. The regimen spans 4 days. On the first and second days: VM26 100mg is added to 250ml of 10% glucose solution for an IV drip lasting 1.5-2 hours for 2 days. Rapid IV drip or direct IV injection of VM26, which can cause a sudden drop in blood pressure, should be avoided, and blood pressure should be monitored during the IV drip to prevent accidents. Since VM26 diluted in room temperature loses efficacy after 4 hours, it should be prepared and used immediately. On the third and fourth days: CCNU 80mg is taken orally every day. Antiemetic drugs, such as metoclopramide, should be administered half an hour before taking the drug to reduce gastrointestinal reactions. After one course of treatment, the next course is repeated every 6 weeks. Generally, the effects of CCNU peak in the fourth week, so routine blood tests for white blood cells and platelets should be performed at the end of the fifth week. If white blood cells fall below 3×109/L and platelets below 90×109/L, chemotherapy should be postponed until blood counts recover before starting the next course. Due to CCNU's cumulative toxicity, it is often necessary to delay the period between courses after 4-5 cycles as blood counts are difficult to maintain. VM26 may be used alone as a transitional measure until blood counts improve before resuming combination therapy. During this time, DNA, squalene, and other supportive therapies can be routinely administered. If the patient tolerates the treatment well, 10-15 courses of treatment can be continued without recurrence as indicated by CT scan. If clinical manifestations are satisfactory, the drug may be discontinued and the patient followed up. 

Immunotherapy: Immunotherapy is still in the experimental stage, and its efficacy is uncertain, requiring further research. 

Other drug treatments: Steroid therapy, with dexamethasone being the most effective, can be given to malignant glioma patients before surgery to reduce cerebral edema and inhibit tumor cell growth, alleviating symptoms before surgical treatment. 

For patients with epileptic seizures, antiepileptic drugs should be administered before and after surgery."

"Anorexia, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, fatigue, dizziness, headache",Renal Failure,"Treatment options for renal failure include: 
Primary Disease Treatment: Persistent and rational treatment of primary or secondary glomerulonephritis, hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, etc.; avoidance or elimination of factors that worsen CRF such as hypovolemia, severe infections, urinary tract obstruction, use of nephrotoxic drugs. 
Dietary Therapy: Caloric intake of 30-35kcal/kg.d. During the compensatory phase of renal failure, a high-quality low-protein (0.6-0.8g/kg.d), low-phosphorus (<750mg/d) diet is recommended, supplemented with essential amino acids or α-keto acids if necessary. For late-stage non-dialysis patients, a high-quality low-protein (<0.6g/kg.d) diet supplemented with essential amino acids or α-keto acids is advised. 
Blood Pressure Control: ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers are preferred, but care should be taken to prevent functional GFR decline. ACEIs should be used with caution or not used at all if serum creatinine exceeds 350μmol/L in non-dialysis patients; diuretics, selective β-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor antagonists may be used as appropriate; dopamine, prostaglandin E1 can be tried for early rapid deterioration of renal function; for refractory hypertension, oral minoxidil, intravenous phentolamine or sodium nitroprusside can be used; immediate dialysis is necessary for hypervolemic hypertension with heart failure. Blood pressure should be controlled around 16.0/11.3kPa (120/85mmHg) without reducing too quickly or too much. 
Maintaining Electrolyte Balance and Correcting Metabolic Acidosis: Appropriate rehydration for early dehydration but not excessively or rapidly; fluid and salt intake restriction for oliguria, edema, and hypertension, intermittently intravenous administration of diuretics, early dialysis for severe edema or heart failure. Potassium intake should be restricted in hyperkalemia; manage according to 'potassium metabolism disorder', emergency hemodialysis for ineffectiveness or anuria with myocardial damage; caution in oral potassium supplementation for hypokalemia. Oral sodium bicarbonate for mild metabolic acidosis; intravenous alkalization or emergency dialysis for severe acidosis, especially with deep rapid breathing or coma, and simultaneous intravenous calcium gluconate to prevent tetany. 
Toxin Removal: Mild cases may use oral reagents such as aldehyde starch, oral dialysis salt, Uremiclear, or renal failure Ning; some patients may benefit from mannitol salt preparations or traditional Chinese medicine enemas; end-stage renal failure requires replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplant)."
"Limb numbness, pain, and weakness",Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH),"Treatment strategies for Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) vary widely due to the heterogeneous nature of the disease, necessitating individualized treatment approaches. Spontaneous remission may occur in a subset of patients; however, most require intervention. Treatment choice is primarily determined by the patient's age, extent of lesions, and the presence of functional impairment in vital organs. Current therapies include local lesion excision, local radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.
1. Lesion Excision: For localized bone EG, lesion excision is preferred, with local radiotherapy as an adjunct post-surgery. This approach often results in cure with a low recurrence rate. Isolated lymph node or skin lesions may be treated similarly. Asymptomatic relapsed lesions can spontaneously regress over weeks to months.
2. Radiotherapy: The role of radiotherapy has been reduced with increasing understanding of LCH and advancements in chemotherapy. Indications for radiotherapy include localized lesions with a tendency to expand, weight-bearing bone lesions, lesions involving or compressing vital organs that are inoperable. Main indications for limited bone lesions involve a daily dose of 200cGy up to a total of 600–1000cGy, achieving over a 90% efficacy rate. For individuals over 18, the dose may be increased to 1500–2000cGy to reduce relapse rates. Radiotherapy for recently symptomatic diabetes insipidus patients targeting the hypothalamic-pituitary area has shown effectiveness, mirroring the treatment for bone lesions. However, skin lesions and extensive organ involvement generally do not respond well to radiotherapy, although it may be considered following chemotherapy for residual localized lesions.
Radiotherapy complications can occur, especially at total doses exceeding 2000cGy, including acute or subacute complications, growth and developmental disorders, and secondary malignancies.
3. Chemotherapy: The use of chemotherapy is cautiously determined due to ongoing debates regarding LCH's neoplastic nature and potential adverse effects. Indications for chemotherapy include multi-organ and multi-site involvement, with younger children at risk of progressing to systemic disease often opting for chemotherapy. Agents commonly utilized include vinca alkaloids (Vincristine, Vinblastine), 6-mercaptopurine, Methotrexate, Doxorubicin, with recent preference for Etoposide (VP-16) or Teniposide (VM26) due to better efficacy. Nucleoside analogs like Fludarabine and 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA) also show effectiveness against LCH resistant to other chemotherapy agents. Chemotherapy dosage is generally lower than for treating tumors, and responses are evaluated 1-2 months post-treatment. Combination with corticosteroids is common, though monotherapy with steroids can also be effective.
4. Immunotherapy: Reports from the 1980s have shown LCH treatment with thymic hormones suggesting induction of suppressor T cell differentiation and maturation. Cyclosporine and Interferon-alpha (IFNα) have shown potential effects through modulation of suppressor T cells, with their efficacy subject to further clinical application and evaluation. Case reports of satisfactory outcomes following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for multisystem involvement and liver transplantation for severe liver dysfunction and failure have also been documented, representing emerging treatment trends."
"Erythema, fever, desquamation",Demodicosis,"Currently, there are no medications that satisfactorily eliminate adult mites, larvae, and eggs of Demodex. However, the following medications can be attempted: 

1. Metronidazole: 0.2-0.4g per dose, three times a day, for a 15-day course of treatment. A second course should be commenced after a half-month break. Contraindicated in pregnant women and individuals with leukopenia. 

2. For those with secondary infections, Erythromycin can be used, 0.25-0.5g, three times a day, or Minocycline, 50mg twice a day, both for a 15-day course. 

3. Topical medications: Effective outcomes can be achieved by maintaining facial cleanliness and applying appropriate medications. 

   (a) 20% Benzyl benzoate emulsion or ointment with 5% sulfur, applied twice daily. 

   (b) 5% Benzoyl peroxide emulsion or wash, applied twice daily. 

   (c) Metronidazole cream, applied twice daily. 

   (d) γ-666 ointment, applied twice daily. 

   (e) For simple or mixed Demodex infections, 12.5% menthol oil can be used, capable of killing all Demodex mites within 4 hours."
"Constipation with severe abdominal pain, anemia, retrograde dissemination of cancer cells, diverticulosis of the digestive tract, constipation, minor lower gastrointestinal bleeding, left and right flank pain, hematochezia, pencil-thin stools, sensation of defecation, intestinal bleeding, black stools with blood",Colorectal Cancer,"What are the treatment methods for colorectal cancer? 
The treatment of colorectal cancer primarily involves surgery complemented by chemotherapy, immunotherapy, traditional Chinese medicine, and other supportive treatments to improve the rate of surgical resection, reduce recurrence, and enhance survival rates. The principles of surgical treatment emphasize radical resection as much as possible, protection of the pelvic autonomic nerves, and preservation of sexual, urinary, and bowel functions to improve the quality of life. Surgical methods include: 
1. Right hemicolectomy, suitable for cancers of the cecum, ascending colon, and hepatic flexure of the colon. 
2. Left hemicolectomy, suitable for cancers of the descending colon and splenic flexure of the colon. 
3. Transverse colectomy, suitable for transverse colon cancers. 
4. For sigmoid colon cancer, besides sigmoidectomy, resection of the descending colon or a segment of the rectum may also be required. 
5. The principle for surgery in the presence of intestinal obstruction allows for primary resection and anastomosis if the patient's condition permits. If the patient's condition is poor, a colostomy may be performed first, followed by a secondary curative resection when the condition improves. 
6. For inoperable cases due to extensive tumor infiltration or fixation to surrounding tissues or organs, or imminent or existing intestinal obstruction, bypass surgery or a colostomy may be performed. Local palliative resection may be used to relieve obstruction, chronic blood loss, and symptoms of infection or poisoning when there is distant organ metastasis but the local tumor is still resectable."
"Persistent severe pain, radiating along the distribution of the trigeminal nerve on the same side, intolerance to cold and hot stimuli",Dental Caries,"What are the treatments for dental caries? Early-stage chronic pulpitis can be treated with indirect pulp capping. In other cases of chronic pulpitis, pulpectomy is used for molars, and pulpotomy for anterior teeth. For young individuals, especially those whose permanent teeth roots are not fully developed, apexification can be considered. During an acute flare-up of chronic pulpitis, initial emergency management should include opening the pulp chamber under local anesthesia to allow for drainage and administering medication for pain relief. Subsequently, molars should be treated with pulpectomy, anterior teeth with pulpotomy, and retrograde pulpitis with pulpotomy combined with periodontal therapy."
"Hemiplegia, limb numbness, hemianopia, aphasia or crossed paralysis, crossed sensory disorders, nystagmus, speech disorders, memory decline, facial and oral asymmetry, dysphagia, dizziness, and headache",Post-stroke Sequelae,"The treatment options for post-stroke sequelae include: 
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM): The recovery and sequelae phases of stroke are best treated primarily with modern Chinese herbal medicine based on large-prescription and authentic sourcing. TCM treatment for this chronic disease has the advantages of non-resistance, lasting effects, and safety suitable for long-term use, though the disadvantages include instability in quality and large dosages required. 
(1) Activating blood circulation to remove blood stasis treatment: A widely used clinical TCM method, this has won the first prize for national scientific and technological progress. It can prevent arteriosclerosis and thrombosis formation, increase cerebral blood flow, and facilitate the absorption of perilesional hematoma and edema, thus improving clinical symptoms. Not applicable for acute phase treatment, focusing on treating the underlying causes. 
(2) Aromatic resuscitation treatment: Known for its ability to unblock channels and regulate blood and qi, this method is clinically effective in treating headaches and limb pain caused by stroke. Aromatic TCM ingredients (e.g., musk) can penetrate the blood-brain barrier directly to the lesion, initiating rapid and definitive therapeutic effects. 
(3) Dual treatment of activating blood circulation and aromatic resuscitation: Recognized in TCM clinical treatments, this approach simultaneously addresses the overall etiology of stroke - blood and vascular disorders. The synergistic action of hundreds of effective components from animal, plant, and aromatic medicines aims to enhance benefits, reduce toxicity, prevent drug resistance, inhibit platelet aggregation, provide efficient anticoagulation, reduce plasma viscosity and lipid peroxides, facilitating the cleaning of lipid substances in the blood and preventing arteriosclerosis. It also increases arterial blood flow, improves cerebral tissue hypoxia tolerance, protects endothelial cells inside blood vessel walls from damage, prevents thrombosis, and improves nervous system control over motor and language functions. 
Western Medicine: Treatments have specific targets but often come with drug resistance and significant side effects, including potential damage to the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys. Therefore, during acute stroke episodes, treatment primarily involves Western medicine, but it's not suitable for long-term use during the recovery and secondary prevention phases. Antiplatelet agents like aspirin and clopidogrel are effective in preventing clot formation but risk resistance and bleeding after long-term use. Calcium channel blockers are effective but have potential adverse effects during prolonged use. 
Combining TCM and Western Medicine: The optimal approach includes rational use of both TCM and Western medicine. Western drugs offer quick and potent effects but have significant side effects and drug resistance, problematic for the predominantly elderly population with stroke. TCM, although slower to take effect, provides long-lasting, resistant, and safe options, especially suited for long-term use by older patients. For stroke recovery, leading with TCM that activates blood circulation and opens orifices, supplemented by one or two targeted Western drugs, can achieve comprehensive treatment of the overall causes, increasing effectiveness, reducing toxicity, and addressing both symptoms and root causes safely and effectively. 
Hirudin Therapy: Post-stroke sequelae primarily result from cerebral tissue damage due to ischemia or pressure and shifting caused by hematomas and cerebral edema. Hirudin, a highly potent thrombin-specific inhibitor derived from the salivary glands of medicinal leeches, can hinder arterial intimal thickening and dilate blood vessel lumens, prevent thrombosis, inhibit platelet aggregation, reduce red blood cell haematocrit, lower fibrinogen levels, and improve blood rheology. It can also inhibit lipid increases and deposition in tissues, showing significant anti-atherosclerotic effects. Studies have shown that hirudin not only dissolves clots formed on the surface of human blood vessels but also, when ingested, its molecules can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, effectively dissolving clots in cerebral vessels. This brings hope to the treatment and recovery of individuals with post-stroke sequelae."
"Excessive sweating, night terrors, cry easily, loss of hair in a ring shape or bald patches at the back of the head, late closure of fontanelles, delayed teething, pigeon chest, funnel chest, inversion of the foot, eversion of the foot",Rickets,"The treatment for rickets depends on its activity phase, aiming to control the disease and prevent deformities. During the active phase for mild cases: Vitamin D at a dosage of 200,000 to 300,000 IU, administered orally or via injection once, with a repeat dose after one month for 1-2 times, along with calcium supplementation at 0.5-1g per dose, twice to thrice daily for a continuous period of 1-2 months. For moderate to severe cases in the active phase: Vitamin D at a dosage of 200,000 to 300,000 IU, administered orally or via injection once, with a repeat dose after one month for 2-3 times, alongside calcium supplementation at 0.5-1g per dose, twice to thrice daily for a continuous period of 2-3 months. During the recovery phase, Vitamin D supplementation is generally not required; increased sun exposure and improved nutrition are recommended. However, to prevent relapse, especially in the winter and spring seasons, Vitamin D at a dosage of 200,000 to 300,000 IU can be administered orally or via injection once. The aforementioned Vitamin D treatment is sufficient for maintaining its effect for 2-3 months; therefore, there is no need for an additional maintenance dose to avoid vitamin D toxicity, and sun exposure is encouraged. Many children during their growth and development may exhibit picky eating or anorexia, leading to a deficiency in essential nutrients (such as zinc and calcium), which can inhibit the secretion of growth hormone and subsequently interfere with growth. Zinc is a vital element in promoting growth hormone production, thus supplementing an adequate amount of zinc is particularly important for those deficient in it. Xinxibao tablets, a third-generation zinc supplement derived from natural seafood, have been shown to have no adverse effects on the human body. In addition to zinc supplementation, it also promotes the absorption of calcium ions in the body, with over a decade of clinical practice demonstrating its significant effects on promoting height growth in children. These are the standard pharmacological treatment approaches. Currently, the specific medications primarily include Vitamin D analogues in the form of tablets, capsules, injections, and emulsions, with Vitamin D3 showing faster absorption and better efficacy compared to Vitamin D2."
"Appearance of pinpoint red macules and urticarial plaques with a distinct orange border around the ankle, severe itching, and frequent lichenification of the skin",Pruritic Urticarial Papules and Plaques of Pregnancy (PUPPP),"Treatment for Pruritic Urticarial Papules and Plaques of Pregnancy (PUPPP) primarily focuses on symptomatic relief. Topical application of corticosteroid formulations can effectively alleviate itching. Oral administration of prednisone is also recommended. Additionally, the use of Carbamylated Erythropoietin (Carbacet) (Anluoxue), Vitamin C, and Vitamin K can significantly improve hemostasis. Since the condition is related to allergic factors, it is prone to recurrence with a general course ranging from 3 to 6 months."
"Shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, fainting, tremors",Panic Disorder,"What are the treatment options for panic disorder? 
 
 Treatment aims to control panic attacks as early as possible, to prevent recurrence and avoid agoraphobia. 
 
1. Early treatment: 
 Upon experiencing the initial panic attack, it is crucial to explain to the patient that the somatic symptoms caused by anxiety might seem frightening but are harmless. It is also important to clarify that the patient's worry about 'losing self-control or dying' is due to cognitive distortions caused by anxiety, which can perpetuate the cycle of anxiety. Hence, to prevent further development of panic disorder, patients should be informed about the significance of avoidance behavior; avoiding places that trigger panic disorder can lead to agoraphobia. 
 
2. Pharmacotherapy: 
 Various medications can be used, including: 
 (1) Tricyclic antidepressants: High doses of some antidepressants can combat panic attacks, making them a first-line option. Imipramine (50–300mg/day) is commonly used. Start with a low dose of 10mg or 25mg, gradually increasing the dosage. Most patients require at least 150mg/day to see effects. Clomipramine (25–200mg/day) can also be used. For those who cannot tolerate anticholinergic side effects, desipramine can be an alternative; elderly patients prone to hypotension may use nortriptyline. Amitriptyline, similar to benzodiazepines in reducing panic attacks, rarely causes dependency or withdrawal reactions, but its onset is slow and has numerous side effects. Initially, amitriptyline can increase the level of alertness, including anxiety, insomnia, and sympathetic nervous system stimulation, therefore starting with a small dosage is advised. Approximately two-thirds of patients who are responsive to benzodiazepines or amitriptyline relapse within six weeks after discontinuation and require further treatment. 
 (2) SSRIs are first-line medications, especially for those intolerant to tricyclic side effects; they are also preferred for patients with co-occurring obsessive-compulsive symptoms or social phobia. Common medications include paroxetine (20–60mg/day), fluoxetine (5–20mg/day), sertraline (50–150mg/day), and venlafaxine (150mg/day). SSRIs such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and the SNRI duloxetine, as well as NaSSA mirtazapine, can also control panic symptoms with effects similar to amitriptyline but without its anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects, though their unique adverse effects may lead some patients to discontinue treatment. 
 (3) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are suitable for those intolerant to other antidepressants, particularly with atypical depression or social phobia. Common medications include phenelzine (15–60–90mg/day) and tranylcypromine (10–80mg/day), taken in the morning. 
 (4) High potency benzodiazepines are indicated for patients intolerant to various antidepressants; those with significant anticipatory anxiety or avoidance behaviors, and cases requiring rapid effectiveness. Common medications include alprazolam and clonazepam. Benzodiazepines must be used in high doses for several months to control panic attacks, which may lead to dependency and withdrawal reactions. Alprazolam is typically used, needing around 6mg/day to control panic attacks (equivalent to 60mg of diazepam), with dosage increases over 2–3 weeks and slow tapering over six weeks or more. 
 (5) Other medications such as venlafaxine (50–75mg/day) and nefazodone (200–600mg/day) may be trialed in patients with poor response to other treatments. 
 Due to the high relapse rate, treatment should generally not be less than six months; some cases may require maintenance medication for 3–5 years for full remission. 
 
3. Psychotherapy: 
 After controlling panic attacks with medication, psychotherapy is often necessary to eliminate anticipatory anxiety and phobic avoidance. 
 (1) Supportive psychotherapy involves explaining the nature of the disease to alleviate the patient's psychological burden, encouraging adherence to the treatment plan, and facilitating participation in group therapy with peers for mutual support, which can be highly effective. 
 (2) Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) performed by clinical psychologists or psychiatrists yields short-term effects comparable to pharmacotherapy and has a lower relapse rate. This approach requires specialization, is time-consuming, and is generally preceded by pharmacological treatment. Options include: β-blockers to control chronic hyperventilation during interictal periods, leading to acute hyperventilation during panic attacks; exercises in breath control to reduce the frequency of panic attacks significantly; exposure therapy to familiarize patients with bodily sensations during attacks, reducing fear of autonomic reactions; and relaxation training including sequential muscle relaxation, health qigong for full-body muscle relaxation and breathing regulation, and cognitive restructuring to provide a rational explanation of the bodily sensations and emotional experiences during attacks, helping patients understand these experiences as benign. 
 
 Prognosis: 
 Panic disorder typically begins in late adolescence or early adulthood, with a secondary peak in incidence around 35–40 years old. Recent findings show it can also occur in childhood. Some cases can fully resolve within weeks, but durations longer than six months tend to result in a chronic fluctuating course. Patients without accompanying agoraphobia have better treatment outcomes, while those with secondary agoraphobia generally have poorer prognoses. About 7% of cases have a history of attempted suicide, and more than half of the patients experience major depressive episodes, significantly increasing suicide risk, warranting close attention."
"Chronic diarrhea, constipation, bloody stool, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, anemia, weight loss",Colorectal Cancer,"What are the treatment methods for colorectal cancer? Basic treatment plans primarily involve surgical removal of the tumor, supplemented by radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and traditional Chinese medicine; recently, endoscopic resection has been successfully used in the treatment of early-stage colorectal cancer, showing favorable outcomes. The selection of the optimal strategy should be based on the clinical pathological staging. Extensive clinical practice has proven the combined treatment plan of traditional Chinese and Western medicine: For patients in Dukes' A stage, surgery is recommended with traditional Chinese medicine, without the need for chemotherapy; in Dukes' B stage, surgery followed by chemotherapy and traditional Chinese medicine is advisable, with radiotherapy also being a viable option for rectal cancer; for Dukes' C stage, colorectal cancer treatment can include surgery followed by chemotherapy and traditional Chinese medicine, with preoperative or postoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer, along with chemotherapy and traditional Chinese medicine; in Dukes' D stage, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, traditional Chinese medicine, and immunotherapy are primarily employed, with surgery only serving palliative purposes. The strengths of both traditional Chinese and Western medicine should be utilized in treating colorectal cancer, insisting on long-term treatment, easing the psychological state of patients, providing psychological therapy, improving dietary nutrition, and enhancing the immune function to achieve better therapeutic effects. Surgical treatment is the most effective method for curing colon and rectal cancer; whenever suitable, early surgical intervention is encouraged. Despite a 50% recurrence and metastasis rate after colorectal cancer radical surgery, preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy may improve the 5-year survival rate post-radical surgery. The preferred anticancer drugs are fluorouracil, followed by mitomycin and doxorubicin. Preoperative radiotherapy can reduce tumor size and improve resection rates, while postoperative radiotherapy can eliminate residual cancer cells. Solo radiotherapy is reserved for late-stage rectal cancer cases, offering benefits such as hemostasis, pain relief, and extended survival. For early-stage mucosal layer cancer, endoscopic removal is possible; for late-stage tumors, stent placement can be performed endoscopically to prevent stricture and obstruction. Traditional Chinese medicine can serve as an auxiliary and supportive therapy to alleviate symptoms and extend survival."
"Dermatitis, itching, bacterial infection, erythema multiforme-like rash, vesicular or bullous lesions, rough skin",Barber's Itch,"Therapeutic approaches for treating lupoid sycosis include systemic treatment with appropriate antibiotics, especially for cases involving seborrheic dermatitis which require active treatment. Physiotherapy or superficial X-ray irradiation may be considered. Local treatment involves hot compresses with a 1:5000 potassium permanganate solution applied 2-3 times a day, followed by antibiotic ointment or cleanser for subacute cases. Traditional Chinese Medicine suggests internal administration of Longdan Xiegan Pills or Zhizi Jinhua Pills and topical application of a mixture of 10% Realgar Jiedu Powder and Huanglian Ointment. Prognosis indicates that purulent follicular orifices heal leaving atrophic scars, leading to follicular destruction and hair loss. The disease course is slow, often chronic, and resistant to treatment."
"Cyanosis, especially of the lips and face, difficulty breathing",Tetralogy of Fallot,"Tetralogy of Fallot - Medical Management: 
Oxygen and sedation are provided during hypoxic attacks with a knee-chest position. Syncope episodes associated with right ventricular outflow spasm leading to further reduction in pulmonary blood flow can be managed with intravenous or oral administration of propranolol and sodium bicarbonate for prevention. 
Surgical Treatment for Tetralogy of Fallot: 
Corrective surgery is the only definitive treatment and is advisable to be performed after the age of ~, although in severe cases, it can be done around the age of ~. Intracardiac repair includes the patch repair of the ventricular septal defect and removal or relief of obstruction at the right ventricular outflow tract including the pulmonary valve stenosis. This thoroughly corrects the anatomical abnormalities, with a good therapeutic effect, although the surgical mortality rate remains high."
"Deformity and swelling of the diseased bone area, nasal congestion, decreased sense of smell, facial asymmetry, exophthalmos, diplopia upon moving the eyes, vision disorders, difficulty in opening the mouth",Fibrous Dysplasia,"What are the treatment options for fibrous dysplasia? 

For fibrous dysplasia, especially the monostotic form, surgical resection is the primary approach due to the potential risk of malignant transformation associated with radiotherapy. Given the slow clinical progression of the disease, surgery may not be immediately necessary for patients with smaller lesions or those who are asymptomatic, but close follow-up observation is essential. For patients experiencing rapid progression of the disease, accompanied by significant deformity and functional impairment, surgery is indicated. Although radical resection is the ideal treatment option, it may lead to functional disability and cosmetic defects. Conservative partial resection has a higher likelihood of recurrence, with a rate of 21% in the monostotic form and up to 36% in the polyostotic form. Surgical techniques and approaches should be flexibly adapted based on the primary site of origin, extent of invasion, and degree of functional impairment, with the principle of thoroughly removing the pathological tissue while preserving organ physiological function and cosmetic appearance to the greatest extent possible. In children and cases with extensive lesions, endotracheal intubation under general anesthesia is preferred during surgery. Localized lesions might also be removed under local anesthesia. Various surgical incisions can be selected according to the condition of the lesion.

1. Caldwell-Luc approach: Suitable for extensive lesions involving the maxilla, nasal cavity, infraorbital wall, ethmoid sinus, and sphenoid sinus.

2. Weber-Fergusson approach: Suitable for patients with extensive involvement of the maxilla, infraorbital wall, zygoma, hard palate, and ethmoid-sphenoid sinus.

3. Craniofacial approach: Includes bi-frontal or uni-frontal flap + Weber-Fergusson incision, applicable to extensive lesions originating from the anterior cranial fossa or nasal sinus, orbital wall, and mutually invasive.

4. Fish method: Applicable to lesions originating in the temporal bone, including the external auditory canal, middle ear, inner ear, petrous bone, and the base of the middle cranial fossa.

Surgical removal with a chisel, round chisel, or large curette in stages is preferable. There is typically more oozing of blood from the wound surface; therefore, bone wax should be used for hemostasis during surgery, and necessary blood transfusion should be provided, especially in children. The prognosis after surgical resection of the disease is generally good, so it is important not to excessively resect adjacent important nerves and blood vessels of the cranial base and intracranium during surgery to avoid complications."
"Children presenting with fever, conjunctival congestion, enlarged tongue papillae, red, swollen, hot and painful feet, diffuse skin erythema, fever with rash, enlarged cervical lymph nodes, irritability, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, cracked lips, bleeding from lips, and headache.",Kawasaki Disease,"The therapeutic objectives during the acute phase of Kawasaki Disease aim at mitigating inflammation and preventing the formation of coronary artery thrombosis. Oral administration of Aspirin along with high-dose Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) forms the cornerstone of therapy. Thrombolytic therapy is necessary in cases where myocardial infarction is precipitated by thrombosis. 
(1) Aspirin: Aspirin serves an anti-inflammatory role and inhibits thrombus formation. However, convincing data regarding aspirin's efficacy in reducing coronary artery abnormalities in mono-therapy is lacking. During the acute phase, the dosage is 80-100 mg/kg/day in divided doses four times a day. In Japan, the dose is slightly lower, 30-50 mg/kg/day. Despite the high doses, due to decreased absorption and increased clearance in children with acute Kawasaki Disease, therapeutic blood concentrations might not be achieved. Monitoring of blood drug levels is required if vomiting, rapid breathing, drowsiness, and liver damage are present. The dosage is reduced to 3-5 mg/kg/day once daily after defervescence or 14 days post-onset, to decrease thrombus formation. Aspirin may be discontinued if no coronary artery aneurysms are detected 6-8 weeks after onset, and if platelet counts and ESR are normal. Continuous aspirin therapy is necessary in cases with persistent coronary artery aneurysms. 
(2) High-dose Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG): Randomized trials have demonstrated that high-dose IVIG (>1g/kg) combined with aspirin is effective and safe in reducing coronary artery anomalies. It should be administered within the first 10 days of illness onset. Retrospective studies reviewing randomized trials suggest an inverse association between IVIG use and coronary artery damage. Administering 2g/kg of IVIG within 10 days of illness onset along with 80-100 mg/kg/day of aspirin can reduce the incidence of coronary artery abnormalities from 20-25% to 2-4%. IVIG is administered every 12 hours. Single-dose treatment, compared to multiple smaller doses, can shorten fever duration and hospital stay, significantly reducing the incidence of coronary artery anomalies in high-risk acute phase patients. The effects of combined aspirin and IVIG administration are swift, with two-thirds of patients defervescing within 24 hours and 90% within 48 hours. The specific mechanism by which high-dose IVIG ameliorates acute phase vasculitis in Kawasaki Disease is not yet fully understood, though current data suggest IVIG can decrease bacterial endotoxin activation of endothelial cells. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies can inhibit the immune reactions caused by the secretion and accumulation of bacterial endotoxins. Data on treatment beyond 10 days of illness onset are lacking. IVIG therapy might still be considered in patients with persistent fever or other signs of infection, as it can ameliorate clinical symptoms. Conversely, IVIG is ineffective if the patient has non-infectious fever, even with coronary artery abnormalities. About 10% of Kawasaki Disease patients continue to exhibit fever despite IVIG treatment. Studies indicate that increases in CRP, LDH, and decreases in hemoglobin are indicators of ineffective IVIG treatment. Limited data suggest that re-treatment with IVIG can be effective in these patients. For those who continue to show persistent fever after a second course of treatment, no effective protocol is recommended. Some reports suggest the potential efficacy of corticosteroid pulse therapy. However, early data from Japan show that steroid treatment in patients who are unresponsive to IVIG therapy may increase the incidence of coronary artery aneurysms and myocardial infarction. 
Post-acute phase treatment involves re-evaluation of platelet count, ESR, and cardiac ultrasound 6-8 weeks after illness onset. Aspirin discontinuation is warranted if laboratory tests return normal and there are no signs of coronary artery damage. Continuous aspirin use is recommended for patients with persistent coronary artery stenosis or aneurysm formation. Vaccine administration should be deferred for at least 6 months following IVIG treatment due to potential interference with vaccine-generated immune responses. 
Long-term management of Kawasaki Disease depends on the extent of coronary artery involvement, categorized by the presence or absence of myocardial ischemia. This categorization aids in effective personalized management, such as long-term medication and physical examinations for diagnosis. Patients without coronary artery involvement or with only transient acute phase coronary artery narrowing do not require long-term aspirin. Invasive tests are also not recommended if there is no restriction in physical abilities. Continued aspirin is mandatory for those with persistent coronary artery narrowing or aneurysm. Aspirin suspension is necessary if a patient contracts chickenpox or influenza to prevent Reye syndrome; Dipyridamole (Persantin) could be used as an alternative, and influenza vaccination is allowed. The continuation of aspirin post-aneurysm resolution is debatable. However, data suggest persistent vascular structure and function abnormalities even after some reversible coronary artery aneurysms have resolved, leaving it unclear whether aspirin should continue in these cases. Annual cardiac ultrasound examinations are necessary for those with small to medium-sized coronary artery aneurysms. Moderate exercise is permitted, but competitive and endurance training is discouraged. Myocardial perfusion pressure measurement is helpful in advising the extent of exercise for older children. Recently, the Dobutamine stress echocardiogram has proven effective in estimating the severity of arterial narrowing in Kawasaki Disease patients. If stress testing indicates coronary artery stenosis, angiography is necessary. Many pediatric cardiologists recommend angiography for all patients with coronary artery aneurysms. Extensive exercise is prohibited for patients with multiple small to medium-sized aneurysms or giant aneurysms. Stress perfusion tests and myocardial perfusion scanning indicate that recreational sports may still be participated in if there is no ischemia. In addition to aspirin, Warfarin therapy is also an option, increasingly used in patients with ischemia who have undergone angiography. Selective angiography can aid in identifying the extent of narrowing damage and guide treatment approaches, including bypass surgery, balloon angioplasty, and other methods to restore coronary blood flow. Arterial grafting has significant advantages over venous grafting. For a minority of patients with severe heart dysfunction not suitable for coronary artery stenting, heart transplantation may be considered."
"General fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, liver function abnormalities, and pain in the liver area",Hepatitis C,"For the treatment of Hepatitis C, it is crucial to confirm that the liver disease in patients is caused by HCV infection. Only those diagnosed with serum HCV RNA positive Hepatitis C require antiviral treatment. The currently recognized most effective regimen is the combination of long-acting interferon PEG-IFNα with Ribavirin, which is also the standard of care (SOC) for chronic Hepatitis C treatment approved by EASL, superior to sole IFNα or the combination therapy of ordinary IFNα or compound IFN with Ribavirin. PEG-IFNα, a long-acting form of interferon, is a molecule of IFNα covalently bound to inert and non-toxic polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules, which delays the absorption and clearance of IFNα after injection, with a longer half-life, allowing for once a week administration to maintain an effective blood concentration. 
Direct-acting Antiviral Agents (DAA), protease inhibitors such as Boceprevir (BOC) or Telaprevir (TVR) combined with interferon and Ribavirin tri-therapy, were approved for clinical use in the United States in May 2011, recommended for patients infected with genotype 1 HCV, to increase the cure rate. Boceprevir (BOC) 800mg is taken thrice daily after meals (every 7-9 hours) or Telaprevir (TVR) 750mg after meals (not low-fat), three times a day (every 7-9 hours). Continuous monitoring of HCV RNA is essential, and protease inhibitors should be discontinued if virological breakthrough (serum HCV RNA rises >1 log from the lowest value) occurs. 
The appropriateness for antiviral treatment includes: 1. General Hepatitis C patients, where interferon treatment has been shown to reduce the chronicity rate of acute Hepatitis C; may be considered 8-12 weeks after the onset of acute HCV infection, with a treatment duration of 12-24 weeks. For chronic hepatitis C, treatment should be considered based on the severity of liver disease, with antiviral treatment suggested for those showing repeated abnormalities in liver function or significant histological inflammation and necrosis (G≥2) or moderate to severe fibrosis (S≥2), which could progress to cirrhosis. For Hepatitis C with cirrhosis, compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) patients may receive antiviral treatment under close observation to stabilize the condition and delay or prevent complications such as liver failure and HCC; those with decompensated cirrhosis often find it difficult to tolerate the side effects of IFNα treatment, and liver transplantation may be considered if feasible. 2. Treatment for special Hepatitis C patients includes considerations for children and elderly, alcohol and drug users, patients with concurrent HBV or HIV infections, and those with chronic renal failure or post-liver transplantation HCV recurrence. Children's treatment experience is not enough but shows higher SVR rates with IFNα alone than adults. Antiviral treatment should also be considered for the elderly, but tolerance is generally lower. Alcohol and drug use exacerbate liver damage and reduce treatment compliance and tolerance. Concomitant HBV infection accelerates disease progression to cirrhosis or HCC; dual active replication of both viruses requires a strategy of first clearing HCV with IFNα and Ribavirin, then treating HBV if necessary. Concomitant HIV infection also accelerates chronic hepatitis C progression, and treatment depends on the patient's CD4+ cell count and stage of liver fibrosis. In patients with chronic renal failure not undergoing dialysis, antiviral treatment is generally not recommended. For patients undergoing dialysis and especially those preparing for kidney transplantation without cirrhosis, monotherapy with IFNα (administered after dialysis) may be considered. For hepatitis C recurrence after liver transplantation, IFNα treatment can be effective but may promote graft rejection, requiring experienced specialists' guidance and close observation."
"Pain, numbness, weakness, muscle atrophy, coldness in the upper limbs, pallor, weakened arterial pulse, edema, and cyanosis.",Thoracic Outlet Syndrome,"Treatment options for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome include: 
1. Conservative Treatment 
Suitable for patients with mild symptoms or at the initial onset: 
  (1) Local Injection: Injection of 1% Procaine 5ml combined with Hydrocortisone 1ml into the muscle within the tender area over the left or right clavicular fossa, once a week, with 3 to 5 sessions constituting one course of treatment. This is particularly effective for patients with muscle strain. 
  (2) Medication: Oral administration of Dexamethasone, Prednisone, and analgesics. 
  (3) Physiotherapy: The use of diathermy or iodine iontophoresis over the clavicular fossa. 
  (4) Shoulder strap muscle exercises, physical therapy, and cervical traction. 
2. Surgical Treatment 
  (1) Indications: Applicable to patients who show no improvement or worsening symptoms after 1 to 3 months of non-surgical treatment, those with ulnar nerve conduction velocity below 60m/s after passing through the thoracic outlet, significant narrowing and obstruction of the subclavian artery and vein as shown by vascular imaging, or those with severe local pain or evident venous compression symptoms. 
  (2) Principle: To relieve the bony scissor-like compression on the neurovascular bundle, excising the entire first rib to eliminate the compression factors, allowing the brachial plexus and the subclavian artery to descend without causing deformities or complications. 
  (3) Approach: Axillary approach involves less surgical trauma and blood loss but may lead to incomplete resection of the first rib due to poor exposure. Supraclavicular approach allows satisfactory resection of the first rib and relief of related compression factors, suitable for repeat surgery patients. The downside is significant trauma and blood loss. Surgical complications include pneumothorax caused by pleural injury, arm numbness or weakness due to brachial plexus traction during surgery, or postoperative hematoma infection. Postoperative symptoms disappear in over 90% of patients."
"Shortness of breath, coughing, cyanosis, three-concave sign, difficulty breathing, restlessness, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, fever, dry cough",Pneumocystis Pneumonia,"What are the treatment methods for Pneumocystis Pneumonia? 
1. Supportive Care: Given the high mortality rate of the condition, early treatment response is generally favorable, allowing for most patients to recover. Therefore, the key lies in early diagnosis and treatment. Patients should rest in bed, receive nutritional support, corrections for electrolyte imbalance and hypoxia, oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula or mask with FiO2 (<50%) when arterial blood oxygen pressure is above 9.32kPa (70mmHg), and mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for severe hypoxia. The use of immunosuppressants should be minimized, however, for patients with severe diffuse lesions, especially those with AIDS, short-term use of corticosteroids such as prednisolone is recommended. 
2. Etiological Treatment: Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim (SMX-TMP) is a preferred treatment drug with significant efficacy, though more than half of the AIDS patients may experience drug side effects. 
3. Pentamidine: Effective against Pneumocystis jirovecii, but with a side effect incidence rate of up to 50%. Its disadvantage lies in significant toxic side effects, mainly nephrotoxicity. It is advocated for use when conventional medications are intolerable or ineffective, and it can still be efficacious. 
For AIDS patients, the treatment duration with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim or pentamidine should be extended to three weeks or longer. Initial treatment efficacy is similar to that in non-AIDS patients, but the occurrence and severity of drug side effects are more pronounced, and relapse rates may reach up to 50%. For patients allergic to TMP-SMX or in case of treatment failure, the following medications may be used: (1) Dapsone plus trimethoprim (TMP); (2) Atovaquone; (3) Clindamycin plus primaquine."
"Abnormal sensation and numbness, pain in the fingers and hand distributed by the ulnar nerve",Thoracic Outlet Syndrome,"Treatment options for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome include: 

1. Conventional Western Medicine Treatment: For early-stage patients, treatment can be through rest and appropriate positioning, i.e., avoiding heavy physical labor, crossing arms in front of the chest with a slight shoulder elevation to relax the brachial plexus. Cervical traction is beneficial for some patients, likely due to reduced pressure on the brachial plexus from muscle relaxation in the traction position. 

Conservative treatment is suitable for patients with mild symptoms or newly diagnosed, including: 

a. Local anesthetic block for significant neck discomfort with visible tender points. This involves using triamcinolone acetonide mixed with bupivacaine for blockade at distinct pain points weekly for 4-6 weeks. Concurrent administration of neurotrophic medications such as thiamine, pyridoxine, and methimazole. 

b. Oral administration of dexamethasone, prednisone, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 

c. Physical therapy including thermotherapy or iodine iontophoresis over the supraclavicular fossa, shoulder girdle muscle exercises, and cervical traction. 

2. Surgical Treatment: Indicated for patients whose symptoms do not improve or worsen after 1-3 months of non-surgical treatment, with ulnar nerve conduction velocity dropping below 60 m/s, significant narrowing or obstruction of the subclavian artery and vein as shown in angiography, or severe localized pain or venous compression symptoms. The principle of surgery is to alleviate bony or fibrous compression on the neurovascular bundle, requiring removal of the first rib and addressing other compressive structures to relieve symptoms. Surgical options include removal of the first rib through various approaches and sympathetectomy if indicated, especially in patients with symptoms like hyperhidrosis, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, Raynaud's phenomenon or disease. 

Post-operative care involves immobilization of the affected limb to an extent that feels comfortable for the patient, with gradual reintroduction of physical therapy and exercises aimed at preventing muscle atrophy, edema, venous thrombosis formation, arterial ischemia, aneurysm, or embolism. Comprehensive evaluation and management considering each patient's unique anatomical and physiological conditions are crucial for effective treatment."

    1. Insertion of 1.1% to 2% phenol glycerin or 10% ichthammol glycerin cotton in the external auditory canal, or application of traditional Chinese medicine for reducing swelling combined with 2% dexamethasone and Coptis ointment locally. Antibacterial and analgesic medications may be necessary. 
    2. Local heat application, physical therapy, or procaine blockade therapy. 
    3. If a furuncle shows fluctuation, incision and drainage may be performed. 
    4. In cases of recurrent infections, underlying chronic wasting diseases such as diabetes mellitus, nephritis, or malnutrition should be looked for and treated accordingly."
"High fever, muscle soreness, chest pain, productive cough, rust-colored sputum, bronchiolar mucosal edema, empyema, pulmonary infection, chills, lethargy, coma, abdominal pain",Pneumococcal Pneumonia,"The treatment options for pneumococcal pneumonia include: 
1. Antibacterial treatment. Treatment with antibiotics should start immediately upon diagnosis, without waiting for bacterial culture results. Penicillin G is the drug of choice for pneumococcal pneumonia. Lincomycin can also be used with a dosage of 2g per day administered intravenously; for severe cases, other cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftriaxone; fluoroquinolone drugs like ofloxacin; and ciprofloxacin can be considered. The course of antibacterial medication usually lasts for 5-7 days, or stops 3 days after defervescence. 
2. Supportive therapy. Patients should rest in bed, with adequate intake of protein, calories, and vitamins, while monitoring respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, and urine output. Pay attention to the potential occurrence of shock. If significant chest pain is present, a small dose of pain reliever, such as codeine 15mg, can be prescribed for relief. Avoid using aspirin or other antipyretics to prevent excessive sweating, dehydration, and errors in clinical judgment. Encourage the consumption of 1-2L of water daily. Oxygen should be given to moderate or severe cases. 
3. Management of complications. 
4. Treatment of septic shock."
"Fever, widespread flushing, tachycardia, asthma, shock, ulcers, bleeding",Eosinophilia,"What are the treatment methods for eosinophilia? Treatment includes key points such as psychosocial interventions which involve removing stressors or disengaging from traumatic environments to enhance coping mechanisms through ventilation, explanation, support, encouragement, and guidance. Pharmacotherapy should not be the first line of treatment for adjustment disorders but can be considered for patients with significant mood disturbances, using antidepressants or benzodiazepines as appropriate. Antianxiety medications for anxiety or fear, antidepressants like imipramine or amitriptyline for depression, and short-term antipsychotic medications like chlorpromazine or fluphenazine for delusions, hallucinations, or impulsive behavior threatening the safety of themselves or others. Low doses and short courses are preferred. Psychosocial interventions should continue alongside medication, especially beneficial for slowly recovering patients. Electroconvulsive therapy may be considered for severe cases with suicidal tendencies or agitation, administering 2-4 treatments. Supportive care including nutrition and hydration is important for patients who are not able to eat or drink adequately. Once stressors disappear but emotional abnormalities remain, psychotherapy is required. It helps solve stress-induced problems and allows emotional ventilation, positively impacting social functions. Behavioral issues in adolescents require individual and family therapy, with regular psychological counseling being crucial. Crisis intervention aims to resolve immediate crises, cognitive-behavior therapy corrects maladaptive thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes to alleviate stress-related disorders, and supportive psychotherapy is very common after stressor cessation, improving maladaptive behaviors and social functionality. It is important to address internal conditions that form mental stress by transforming cognition and values that lead to a change in emotional and behavioral responses. Taoist-based psychological treatments following principles of benefiting without harming, striving without competing, reducing selfish desires, knowing contentment, embracing harmony, and adhering to naturalness can aid in alleviating mental stress. The treatment process includes exploring stressors, assessing values, evaluating coping strategies, educating on Taoist life philosophy, and objectively evaluating treatment outcomes over a period from one month to half a year. Overall, collective education and individual discussions focus on finding solutions to psychological crises and adopting new cognitive approaches through Taoist philosophy, aiming for a readjustment to life, social reintegration, and mental health improvement. Prognosis is generally good with appropriate treatment, with most recovering within a few months to six months. Adolescents might experience a slightly longer course with risk of suicidal behavior, and substance abuse or dependence issues should be considered. For patients not improving over years, unresolved stressors and the possibility of other undiagnosed mental disorders should be explored."
"Pain, swelling, limited mobility",Osteoarthritis,"The treatment modalities for osteoarthritis involve adhering to rest, ice packs, compressive bandaging, and elevation of the affected limb to achieve satisfactory outcomes. Within the acute phase of 24 to 48 hours, cold compresses can be applied for 10 to 20 minutes every 6 hours, followed by heat application for 2 to 3 days after 48 hours to promote the rapid absorption of local tissue exudates and alleviate pain. If necessary, adhesive plaster dressings can be used to immobilize the ankle for 2 to 3 weeks. On the other hand, conservative treatment outcomes for patients with chronic injuries are relatively poor. The goal of treating osteoarthritis is to improve pain and instability. Sometimes, it may be necessary to undergo surgery to reconstruct ligaments for enhancing ankle stability; minimally invasive arthroscopic surgery can also be employed to address pain factors such as synovial chondromalacia or loose bodies."
"Milk discharge, amenorrhea, headaches, limb hypertrophy, infertility, vision disorders",Galactorrhea,"Treatment options for galactorrhea include: 
1. Discontinuation of causative drugs such as reserpine, chlorpromazine, perphenazine, or methotrimeprazine can result in normalization of prolactin levels, restoration of menstrual function, and cessation of milk discharge generally within 2-7 months after stopping the medication. For galactorrhea induced by oral contraceptives, normalization of menstrual cycles may require additional treatments to correct the cycle; normal ovulation and menstrual cycles typically resume, leading to a gradual disappearance of lactation. 

2. Medical treatment includes: 
   - Thyroxine for primary hypothyroidism-induced galactorrhea, which involves replacement therapy leading to the disappearance of lactation and restoration of menstrual function. 
   - Bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist acting on hypothalamic dopamine receptors and directly on pituitary lactotrope cells, which helps restore normal ovulatory menstrual cycles for treating galactorrhea caused by pituitary adenomas or idiopathic reasons. Initial dose is 1.25mg twice daily, increasing to 2.5mg 2-3 times per day after 4 days, with a maximum initial dose for large pituitary adenomas being 7.5-12mg, and total dose ranging from 75-950mg. Main side effects include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and stomach discomfort, which generally improve after the first week of treatment. Recurrence may occur after discontinuation or post-pregnancy, with re-treatment being effective. It's important to stop the medication immediately after pregnancy diagnosis to prevent fetal malformations, though reports suggest no fetal malformation in cases of early pregnancy exposure. 
   - Levodopa (L-dopa) for non-pituitary tumor-induced galactorrhea, enhancing the inhibitory effect of prolactin inhibitory factor and decreasing prolactin levels, with most patients experiencing recovery 1.5 months after initiation and milk discharge disappearing within 1.5 to 2 months. Usage is 0.5mg, three times daily, for six months, with the main side effects being nausea and vomiting, and symptom recurrence possible after discontinuation. 
   - Gonadotropin treatment to improve ovarian function and restore hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis physiological function. Administration: human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) injections containing 75U each of FSH and LH, one injection per day for 7-10 days, until sufficient estrogen effect is confirmed through vaginal smears, cervical mucus crystallization, or blood and urine estrogen levels, demonstrating follicular maturation before administering human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) 2000U for 2-3 days to induce ovulation. 
   - CB-153: Demonstrates similar effects to dienestrol, with administration guidelines being one capsule each evening. 
   - Clomiphene: Aims to fully restore hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis function and induce ovulation, starting on the fifth day of a natural or artificially induced menstrual cycle at a dosage of 50mg, once daily for five days. 
   - Vitamin B6 acts as a coenzyme for dopamine decarboxylase, facilitating the conversion of dopamine to its active form and stimulating PIF (Prolactin Inhibiting Factor), thus inhibiting PRL (Prolactin) secretion, at a dosage of 200-600mg daily for long-term use. This treatment remains experimental and not widely adopted. 
3. Surgical treatment for large pituitary adenomas (>3cm), craniopharyngiomas, or thyrotoxicosis-induced galactorrhea. 
4. Radiation therapy is an option for pituitary adenomas not suitable for surgery."
"High fever, chills, and symptoms of meningeal irritation",Orbital Cellulitis,"The treatment modalities for orbital cellulitis include: 

1. Performing bacterial culture of the affected tissue area and administering antibiotics sensitive to the cultured pathogens. In cases where the pathogen is not identified, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be used. It is advisable to administer a high dosage intravenously. Concurrently, any sinusitis should be addressed. After improvement in the patient's condition, medication should continue for a week or switch to oral administration.

2. Prognosis: With timely and accurate treatment, inflammation can subside without residual sequelae. However, if not addressed properly, the inflammation can spread to deeper portions, leading to complications such as deep orbital cellulitis, septic cavernous sinus thrombosis, and even life-threatening sepsis, with a mortality rate of 19%. Cases of blindness have also been reported."
"Erythema, oily scales, crust-like scales, papules, scalp crusts, dermatitis",Seborrheic Dermatitis,"What are the treatment options for Seborrheic Dermatitis? Western medicine treatment involves dietary restrictions with reduced intake of fats and carbohydrates while increasing vegetable consumption. Minimizing the use of soap and hot water for hair washing is advised, as frequent washing can stimulate sebum secretion; conversely, less frequent washing can lead to accumulated sebum exerting back-pressure, thus reducing sebaceous gland activity and secretion. Avoiding mechanical irritations such as scratching and combing is also recommended. Systemic treatment includes: 1. Vitamin therapy: Vitamin B6 60mg daily, divided into three oral doses; Vitamin B2 30mg daily, divided into three oral doses; or a compound Vitamin B tablet 6 pieces daily, divided into three oral doses. 2. Antipruritic sedatives: Diazepam 7.5mg daily, divided into three oral doses for severe itching; Diphenhydramine 12mg daily, divided into three oral doses. 3. Corticosteroids and antibiotics: Suitable for severe cases, e.g., Seborrheic Erythroderma. Prednisone 10mg three times daily, Tetracycline or Erythromycin 0.25g four times daily. 4. Antifungal medication: Ketoconazole 0.2g once daily for 10-15 days. Topical treatments aim to dissolve sebum, reduce seborrhea, provide antibacterial, antifungal, and antipruritic effects. These include: 1. Corticosteroid formulations such as Fluocinonide, Clobetasol propionate urea cream applied to affected areas 2-3 times daily. 2. Antibiotic formulations: 1% Erythromycin alcohol and ointments, 1% Chloramphenicol Resorcinol solution. 3. Antifungal agents: Ciclopirox Olamine 2% shampoo (containing 2% ketoconazole) and Selenium sulfide detergents mainly for scalp application, used twice a week; 2% ketoconazole cream, applied to affected areas 2-3 times daily. 4. Others: 5% sulfur ointment, 5% Salicylic acid alcohol applied to affected areas twice daily. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment involves differentiated treatment strategies. External treatment includes herbal washes and ointments with specific formulations. Additionally, specialized formulae for oral consumption are proposed based on individual diagnosis. Acupuncture treatment targets specific points related to Seborrheic Dermatitis, incorporating methods like needling and auricular point injection with Angelica sinensis injection fluid for systematic therapy over several sessions."
"Increased red blood cells, increased white blood cells, increased platelets, hepatosplenomegaly, nosebleeds, gum bleeding, erythromelalgia, dizziness, headache, hypertension",Polycythemia Vera,"The treatment objectives for polycythemia vera are to normalize blood volume and red blood cell mass as quickly as possible, suppress bone marrow hematopoiesis, thereby alleviating symptoms and reducing complications.

1. Phlebotomy

Phlebotomy can reduce blood volume to normal in a short time, alleviate symptoms, and decrease the chances of bleeding and thrombosis. Blood is drawn every 2-3 days, 200-400ml each time, until the red blood cell count is below 6.0×10^12/L, and hematocrit is below 50%. The effect of a single phlebotomy can last for more than a month. This method is simple and can be used initially. Younger patients, if without thrombotic complications, may be treated with phlebotomy alone. However, rebound increases in red blood cells and platelets can occur after phlebotomy; repeated procedures may aggravate iron deficiency, requiring attention. In elderly patients, or those with cardiovascular diseases, the volume of phlebotomy should not exceed 200-300ml at a time, with longer intervals between sessions. Blood cell separation can be used to draw large volumes of red blood cells, but it should be accompanied by the infusion of an equivalent volume of plasma to dilute the blood.

2. Chemotherapy

(1) Hydroxyurea - an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, effectively suppresses polycythemia vera without causing leukemogenic side effects, at a daily dosage of 15-20mg/kg. If the white blood cell count is maintained at 3.5-5×10^9/L, hydroxyurea can be used long-term intermittently.

(2) Alkylating agents - effective in 80% to 85% of cases. Cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil act quickly, while busulfan and melphalan offer longer remission, lasting about six months. Melphalan, with fewer side effects and less likely to cause thrombocytopenia, has the advantage. Alkylating agents also pose a risk of inducing leukemia, though lower than radiopharmaceuticals.

(3) Trisenox (arsenic trioxide) - Reported to reduce hematocrit and hemoglobin to normal levels when administered intravenously with 10% glucose, daily, continuously, or intermittently until reaching normal levels. The average time to achieve remission is 60 days, with a median remission period of more than 18 months.

3. α-Interferon Treatment

Interferon has cell proliferation inhibitory effects. Recently, it has also been used in treating this disease. After 3 months of subcutaneous injections, splenic size reduces, and the number of phlebotomies decreases. The response rate can reach up to 80%.

4. Radiopharmaceuticals

Phosphorus-32 (32P) β-radiation can suppress cellular division, thus reducing cell counts. Red blood cell counts begin to decrease after about six weeks, and approach normal within 3-4 months, alleviating symptoms, with an effectiveness of approximately 75% to 80%. If the condition does not improve after 3 months, another dose may be administered. Remission can last for 2-3 years. However, there is a risk of transformation into leukemia, making its use less common in recent years.

5. Supportive Treatment

(1) Secondary gouty arthritis: Treated with allopurinol and anti-inflammatory analgesics.

(2) Pruritus: Oral administration of cetirizine, diphenhydramine, or cimetidine.

(3) For cases with symptoms of peripheral or cerebral ischemia, short-term antiplatelet aggregation drugs such as aspirin or dipyridamole are recommended."

Medical Management: Timely control of respiratory infections to prevent infective endocarditis. In severe cases, β-blockers are used to alleviate right ventricular outflow tract obstruction and prevent hypoxic episodes. 
 
Surgical Treatment: Complete corrective surgery under direct visualization includes the resection of hypertrophic muscle bundles in the right ventricular outflow tract, separation of the stenosed valves, and repair of the ventricular septal defect. This operation is relatively comprehensive. The optimal age for surgery is between 5 and 8 years. However, if the symptoms are severe, shunt operations can be considered in children under 3 years old, such as subclavian artery, aorta, or superior vena cava to pulmonary artery anastomosis, to establish systemic-to-pulmonary circulation and improve hypoxia, preparing for future corrective surgery. In cases where corrective surgery is not possible, procedures like pulmonary valve or infundibulum incision may be considered to relieve right ventricular obstruction, increase pulmonary blood flow, and reduce right-to-left shunting."
"Joint pain, muscle atrophy, joint deformity",Osteoarthritis,"Treatment options for osteoarthritis include: 
General Treatment: Education on disease prevention and joint protection is crucial. Physical exercises should be gradual to prevent joint overuse and bearing excessive weight, avoiding mechanical joint injuries. In severe cases, immobilization or plaster fixation may be necessary to prevent deformity. Reducing body weight and using handles or canes can lessen the load on affected joints. Occupational adjustments might be required. Exercises for specific muscle groups can maintain and improve joint mobility and stability. 
Physical Therapy: Therapies such as thermotherapy, hydrotherapy, infrared, ultrashort waves, and electrical stimulation enhance local blood circulation, relieve muscle tension, and reduce pain. Traction therapy is particularly effective for patients with cervical spondylosis of the nerve root type, as it can relax muscles, relieve pain, and prevent adhesion of adjacent tissues to the nerve root, under the guidance of a specialist. 
Massage and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM): TCM techniques, such as massage and acupuncture, have significant effects on alleviating symptoms of osteoarthritis. Topical herbal patches can also be effective in activating blood circulation and relieving pain. 
Medication Therapy: Analgesics like acetaminophen have analgesic effects but weak anti-inflammatory properties. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have characteristics of anti-inflammatory and pain relief, improving joint mobility after administration. 
Corticosteroids: Systemic medication is not recommended. In cases where other treatments are ineffective, and there is acute inflammation of the joint or surrounding synovitis, dermatitis, etc., local injections into the joint cavity or affected area can be considered. Repeated use is not advisable, and the interval between injections at the same site should be at least 3 months. 
Chondroprotective agents: Such as glucosaminoglycans, can alleviate symptoms and maintain or restore joint function. 
Viscosupplementation: Involves injecting a solution of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid (HA) into the joint cavity to reduce synovitis, cartilage destruction, and improve joint function, thereby disrupting the local vicious cycle of the disease. 
Surgical and Arthroscopic Treatment: Approaches vary according to the disease's progression and may include arthroscopic joint lavage, osteochondral transplantation, chondrocyte or mesenchymal stem cell transplantation, osteotomy for severe joint deformity, and joint replacement for severe joint destruction and functional impairment. 
Other Treatments: Autologous cartilage transplantation is generally limited to joint cartilage defects smaller than 2cm2. The transplantation of bone columns or autologous cartilage from non-weight bearing areas of the femur to treated cartilage defects in the femoral joint surface. Gene therapy for osteoarthritis has also become a focus of research. Additionally, since the 1980s, the use of cartilage powder from shark fins to promote joint regeneration has emerged as an alternative treatment in advanced countries. Such alternative treatments aim to fundamentally and safely address the issues compared to traditional methods that often carry high surgical risks and may not provide a cure."
"Dementia, Seizures, Fragile X Syndrome, Autism, Retrograde Amnesia, Coma, Progressive Dementia, Paralysis",Intellectual Disability,"What are the treatment methods for intellectual disabilities? 
Treatment: There is currently no effective pharmacological treatment for congenital intellectual disabilities. Traditional Chinese medicine and rehabilitation training may be attempted. Intellectual disabilities resulting from traumatic brain injuries, metabolic disorders, or poisoning are primarily treated by addressing the underlying brain disease and through rehabilitation treatments. 
Dementia, the most common acquired progressive cognitive disorder, has seen various advancements in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the clinical treatment of AD remains a global challenge to be overcome. Research in the 1970s focused on the relationship between acetylcholine and AD; the 1980s concentrated on the impact of cholinesterase inhibitors on AD; and the 1990s included not only acetylcholine receptor agonists but also estrogens, anti-inflammatories, drugs affecting free radical metabolism, and drugs inhibiting amyloid protein deposition. Ultimately, all treatments are based on the etiological hypothesis. Apart from a few that can temporarily ameliorate symptoms, no method has been conclusively proven effective. 
Prognosis: Currently, there is no available data."
"Dry nose, fatigue, cough, photophobia, dull facial complexion, increased abdominal girth, bulging abdominal veins, vomiting",Splenomegaly,"The treatment for Splenomegaly should focus on regulating the spleen and stomach, with modified Bohe Wan (Harmonizing Pill) as commonly prescribed. In cases of prolonged illness with progressive emaciation, sallow complexion, chest oppression, enlarged liver and spleen, minimal breast milk intake, frequent acidic-smelling diarrhea, lethargy, reduced physical energy, reluctance to speak, and reduced mobility, indicating the formation of Ghan accumulation, the therapeutic approach should shift to eliminating Ghan and strengthening the spleen, utilizing Fei Er Wan (Fattening Baby Pill) and modified Shen Ling Bai Zhu San. Generally, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) shows better outcomes for iron-deficiency anemia, but when the patient's Hemoglobin (Hb) is less than 60g/L and continuous bleeding is present, Western medicine iron supplements should be considered if TCM alone is ineffective, with intramuscular iron injections administered if necessary."
"Sensory deficits, motor dysfunction, paralysis",Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome,"What are the treatment methods for Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome?
Treatment involves selecting cases with progressive sensory deficits who, upon comprehensive neurological examination, can exclude primary lesions in the posterior horn of the spinal cord, indicating that surgery should be performed as soon as possible. The main principle of surgery includes performing laminectomy decompression under local or general anesthesia. The procedure aims to eliminate any compressive agents on the dural sac, striving to restore the tension and pulsatility of the dural sac as the primary goal. Generally, there is no need to incise the dura to inspect the posterior spinal artery situation in order to prevent accidents. For patients without contraindications to surgery, early surgical exploration and decompression should be pursued.
 Prognosis
Early surgical exploration and decompression generally result in a satisfactory clinical recovery."
"Convulsions, chills, high fever, diffuse skin erythema, and leukocytosis",Erysipelas,"Erysipelas can be managed with a differentiation of syndromes approach: 
1. For cutaneous heat toxin syndrome, characterized by local skin erythema resembling cloud patches, with lifted warmth and pain that fluctuates in location, accompanied by fever, chills, irritability, frequent crying in infants, dry lips, dry mouth, a red tongue, and a white or yellow coating: The treatment focuses on clearing heat and detoxifying. 

2. For toxin invading the heart and liver syndrome, manifested by local skin presenting with lifted red swelling and pain, high fever, irritability, confusion, convulsions, dry lips, dry mouth, a dark reddish tongue with little coating: The treatment involves purging fire to detoxify, and extinguishing wind to open the orifices."
"Skin swelling, skin rupture and necrosis, localized redness and pain",Pyogenic Granuloma,"What are the treatment methods for pyogenic granuloma? Firstly, it is crucial to remove the irritating factors and promptly correct any adverse habits such as lip-biting. If the lesion has not yet reddened and is small, removing irritating factors and adopting anti-inflammatory symptomatic treatment promptly is advised. Generally, the lesion can gradually subside and may not require surgery. For patients with ulcerative lesions, local anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and healing-promoting treatments should be applied; for larger proliferative ulcerative lesions, surgical excision may be considered."
"Conjunctival congestion, conjunctival papillary hyperplasia, petechiae on the conjunctiva, conjunctival edema and corneal ulceration, hard and flat papillae on the palpebral conjunctiva, palpebral conjunctival congestion, exposure of yellow pus spots",Pterygium,"The treatment methods for pterygium mainly involve medication and surgery, dictated by the condition’s severity and the specific symptoms. For pterygia that are thin and white, topical medications are primarily used; for those that are thick and red with excessive tear production, oral medications are added. Treatments are tailored based on the differentiation of wind-heat, substantial heat, and deficient heat conditions. Substantial conditions require purging, while deficient conditions call for cooling methods, requiring distinct approaches. In cases where medication is ineffective and the condition progresses rapidly, surgical intervention is recommended. 

Internally, depending on the pathology: 
1. For wind-heat in the heart and lungs characterized by the initial growth of the pterygium, discomfort, and excessive tearing, an approach to expel wind and clear heat is adopted, using modified versions of the Zhizi Shengqi San formula. 
2. For substantial heat in the spleen and stomach marked by rapid growth, discomfort, thirst, constipation, and dark urine, methods to purge heat and facilitate bowel movements are employed, using modified Xie Pi Chu Re Yin. 
3. For yin deficiency leading to hyperactive fire presenting as variable redness, itching, irritability, and dry mouth, nourishing yin and reducing fire strategies are used, adjusting Zhibai Dihuang Wan as needed. 

Externally, treatment involves: 
1. For red, itching pterygia with excessive tearing, using Baobao eye medication or medication for red eyes. 
2. In cases where the pterygium progresses rapidly, threatening the cornea and potentially impacting vision, surgical removal is considered. Surgery needs careful consideration due to the risk of recurrence, with emphasis on thorough removal to minimize the chance of recurrence."
"Whitening of the skin, itching",Vitiligo,"What are the treatment options for vitiligo?
Preoperative preparation:
1. On the evening before the surgery, personal hygiene should be thoroughly attended to, and fasting should commence after 12 a.m.
2. It is advisable to prepare comfortable clothing (loose-fitting, easy to wear around the neck, low-heeled light shoes) and items to cover the surgical site such as masks, scarves, hats, and sunglasses.
3. A comprehensive evaluation of the patient's overall health should be conducted, including checking for any signs of a cold, infections in the donor site or the local surgical area, such as rashes.
Surgical treatment:
There are no specific treatment methods, but PUVA therapy, melanocyte transplantation, and autologous normal melanin small piece skin grafting can be attempted.
Prognosis:
1. The success rate is influenced by the skill level of the surgeon.
2. The success rate is affected by aseptic operation practices; any infection can lead to the failure of the surgery.
3. There will always be differences in color and texture between the transplanted skin and the surrounding normal skin.
4. Patients prone to hypertrophic scars or keloids may develop thickened scars or keloids after this treatment.
5. This method is not suitable for the treatment of progressive and extensive vitiligo."
"Groin pain, reducible mass in the groin area, pain in the hernia area, sensation of dragging or heaviness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, indigestion, abdominal bloating",Inguinal Hernia,"Treatment options for inguinal hernia include conservative management and surgical intervention. Once an inguinal hernia becomes irreducible, it can lead to intestinal obstruction and potentially fatal conditions such as intestinal necrosis and perforation. 
1. Conservative Management: This includes the use of hernia belts, trusses, and traditional Chinese medicine to alleviate symptoms or delay the progression of the disease. However, these methods cannot cure the hernia, and inappropriate conservative treatments may worsen the condition. This approach is only suitable for infants under two years old, the elderly, or individuals with severe comorbidities, primarily using specially designed hernia belts to relieve symptoms. 
2. Surgical Treatment: Surgery is the only reliable method to treat adult inguinal hernias with a lower recurrence rate. Easily reducible hernias can be treated with elective surgery, while irreducible hernias should be operated on promptly. Incarcerated and strangulated hernias require emergency surgery to avoid severe consequences. Surgical treatments can be divided into traditional tissue-to-tissue tension repair and tension-free hernia repair techniques. The internationally recognized standard is the tension-free hernia repair technique, including both open and laparoscopic approaches. 
 (1) Traditional Surgery involves preoperative and postoperative fasting, postoperative bed rest, intravenous fluids, the placement of a urinary catheter, and is associated with severe postoperative pain, slow recovery, and a high recurrence rate. Many patients with concurrent heart, lung, or cerebrovascular diseases may not tolerate general or local anesthesia, thus cannot undergo surgery. 
 The open tension-free hernia repair technique, introduced from abroad, has rapidly become popular. The surgery can be performed under local anesthesia with a low recurrence rate, minimal pain, and typically requires a hospital stay of only 2 to 5 days or can even be completed on an outpatient basis, leading to a faster recovery. 
 (2) Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Repair has made significant advancements in recent years. The totally extraperitoneal (TEP) approach requires only two 0.5 cm and one 1 cm incisions without entering the abdominal cavity. It involves retracting the hernia sac back into the abdomen and covering the herniated opening with a synthetic mesh. This method is suitable for bilateral inguinal hernias and recurrent hernias, offering minimal trauma, quick recovery, and a low recurrence rate."
"Itching, scratching marks, redness, swelling, and pain in the vulva",Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus,"Treatment for Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus involves both Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Western medicine approaches.
 
In TCM, treatment varies based on the nature and symptoms of the condition, treating itchiness and sores on the vulva by addressing 'Wind in the Yin' and 'Moist Heat Encumbrance'. Factors such as kidney essence deficiency, liver blood insufficiency that leads to inadequate nourishment of the vulva, attack by external pathogenic wind, or damp-heat lodgment are considered central to the disease mechanism. TCM therapies aim at nourishing the liver and kidney, enriching the blood, dispelling wind to relieve itching, clearing heat, detoxification, dampness, promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis, and dispelling wind. Specific TCM strategies include enriching the blood and dispelling wind, activating blood circulation, clearing heat and removing dampness, removing spots and relieving itching, warming the kidneys and assisting yang, as well as nourishing the blood and yin. Additionally, TCM emphasizes a comprehensive treatment approach combining dietary modification, herbal remedies, and lifestyle adjustments.
 
Western medical treatment suggests the use of topical steroids like 1% hydrocortisone and 1-2% testosterone ointment, recommended to be applied 3-4 times daily for 6-8 weeks. Maintaining genital hygiene, wearing loose-fitting cotton underwear, and avoiding allergenic foods are crucial practices. For cases with severe itching affecting sleep, appropriate sedative medications might be prescribed. If the condition progresses or is unresponsive to conservative treatments, surgical interventions can be considered, especially when severe atrophy, labial adhesions, or decreased vaginal orifice affects urination or sexual intercourse. Pregnancy is not impacted by this condition, and natural vaginal delivery is possible in cases without significant atrophy. For more complicated deliveries, cesarean sections may be considered. The overall strategy involves long-term management to prevent recurrence, adjusting treatment intensity based on symptom improvement."
"Headache, fever, chills, general malaise",Scrub Typhus,"What are the treatment methods for Scrub Typhus? 
    Tetracycline, doxycycline and chloramphenicol are all effective in treating this disease. Medication should continue for at least 2 days after the fever subsides. 
1. General treatment involves bed rest, consuming easily digestible liquid or semi-liquid food. Supplement intake of B-group vitamins and vitamin C. Ensure regular bowel movements and a urine output of approximately 2000ml/day. 
2. Etiological treatment may consider the following antimicrobial agents: 
    (1) Macrolides, including Erythromycin, Roxithromycin, Azithromycin, and Clarithromycin, are effective against Scrub Typhus. The common dosage for Erythromycin is 1.2g/d for adults and 25-30mg/(kg·d) for children, taken 3 to 4 times daily or administered twice or thrice daily via intravenous drip. The usual Roxithromycin dose is 300mg/d for adults, 100mg/d for children weighing 12-23kg, and 200mg/d for those weighing 24-40kg, taken twice daily with the first dose potentially doubled. Azithromycin's standard adult dosage is 0.25g once daily, orally, with the initial dose possibly doubled. Clarithromycin's common dosage is 500mg twice daily, orally, which may be reduced to 250mg per dose after the fever subsides. Most patients experience rapid defervescence within 24 hours after medication, with the treatment lasting 8-10 days. Macrolides are not recommended for patients with significant liver dysfunction. 
    (2) Tetracyclines, including Tetracycline, Doxycycline, and Minocycline, also exhibit good efficacy against Scrub Typhus. Tetracycline's usual dosage is 2g/d for adults and 25-40mg/(kg·d) for children, taken in four divided doses. For Doxycycline, the common dosage is 0.2g/d for adults and 4mg/(kg·d) for children, taken once daily or in two divided doses with the first dose potentially doubled. Minocycline's standard dosage is 0.2 g/d for adults and 4mg/(kg·d) for children, taken once or twice daily, with an initial double dose. The treatment duration is typically 8-10 days. Tetracyclines are not suitable for children under 8 years, pregnant women, or nursing mothers. 
    (3) Chloramphenicol shows good efficacy against Scrub Typhus. The typical dosage is 2g/d for adults and 25-40mg/(kg·d) for children, administered either as an intravenous drip daily or in four divided oral doses. Patients usually experience rapid defervescence within 24 hours, and the dosage should be halved after the fever subsides, continuing for 7-10 days to prevent relapse. Due to the potential induction of aplastic anemia, Chloramphenicol should not be the first choice of treatment. It is unsuitable for young children, pregnant, or nursing women. 
    (4) Quinolones may also be considered."
"Facial numbness, weakness of facial muscles, hearing loss, ataxia, diminished vision, and visual field defects",Epidermoid Cyst,"What are the treatment methods for epidermoid cysts? Surgical treatment is generally the first choice for epidermoid cysts. Some tumors that are small, without intracranial extension or infection, and only mildly adherent to surrounding structures, especially epidermoid cysts in the fourth ventricle, can be completely excised. For tumors that are closely adherent to surrounding tissues, complete removal is not advisable. The tumor capsule contains viable parts, and the area around the tumor should be protected with a surface sheet to prevent the spread of tumor debris with cerebrospinal fluid. After carefully removing the contents of the cyst, the non-adherent parts of the cyst wall should be excised as widely as possible, and flushed repeatedly with saline to prevent postoperative aseptic meningitis. Epidermoid cysts within the cranial bone plate can remain small for a long time and are only incidentally discovered on skull films. Epidermoid cysts that grow or are tender require removal, which generally is not difficult to achieve through complete excision. Other therapies include radiotherapy for malignant transformations of epidermoid cysts, although benign ones are not sensitive to radiotherapy."
"Ear pain, heart failure, ear discharge, fever with rash, difficulty breathing, cough, diarrhea",Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH),"Treatment options for Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis include: 

- Pharmacotherapy: Oral Prednisone at a dosage of 1mg/kg daily is initially recommended, with a gradual reduction in dosage after 2 months. 

- Chemotherapy: Under the supervision of pediatric oncology specialists, chemotherapy with drugs such as Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine, 6-Mercaptopurine, and Methotrexate is often employed, using a combination therapy approach. 

Prognosis: Treatment of LCH is highly challenging, with unsatisfactory results. The mortality rate is high, reaching up to 70%."
"Difficulty in opening the mouth, trismus, severe pain, hoarseness, difficulty breathing, respiratory obstruction, chills, high fever, headache, and edema",Submandibular Space Infection,"Treatment options for submandibular space infection include: 
1. Early treatment involves the use of adequate, effective antibiotics and symptomatic treatment. The primary principle is early decompression and sufficient drainage, especially for Ludwig's angina. Local heat application and physical therapy may also be tried in the early stages of sublingual space infection. 
2. For abscess formation, local incision and drainage are performed through the following approaches: 
(a) Intraoral incision and drainage: For sublingual space infections limited above the mylohyoid muscle of the mandible, an incision can be made intraorally on the inner side of the alveolar prominence or at the floor of the mouth. Under local anesthesia, an incision is first made on the mucosa above the abscess, followed by insertion of a blunt-ended curved hemostat into the abscess cavity to enlarge the incision for drainage. However, care should be taken to avoid damaging the lingual vessels and nerve. If symptoms persist or the patient has trismus or severe infection after intraoral drainage, external drainage through the suprahyoid region should be considered. 
(b) Submandibular incision and drainage: Drainage of cellulitis of the floor of the mouth should be performed under local or general anesthesia. If laryngeal obstruction occurs, a timely tracheotomy should be conducted, typically with intubation through the tracheotomy. An incision is made below the mandible body in the midline or a horizontal incision connecting the angles of the mandible. The platysma and mylohyoid fascia are incised vertically to expose and ligate the external carotid artery's submental branch. The deep fascia of the submandibular gland is freed medially at the intersection of the anterior and posterior bellies of the digastric muscle, and the gland is retracted superolaterally to expose the submandibular triangle and lingual artery. Then, the mylohyoid muscle is vertically separated along its fibers, enlarged, and a cigarette or tube drain is inserted. The oral mucosa may be incised or left intact, and the skin incision is left open without suturing to change the anaerobic environment and ensure sufficient drainage. The wound is irrigated with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution or 1:5000 potassium permanganate solution. 
Surgical precautions include avoiding cutting through the digastric muscle, geniohyoid muscle, or submandibular gland; necessitating the incision of the suprahyoid fascia and mylohyoid muscle for optimal decompression; multiple incisions in the mylohyoid muscle to ensure unobstructed drainage; removal of cigarette or tube drains on the third postoperative day to prevent vascular compression and bleeding; and the incised tissue may appear frozen with serosanguinous exudate with a foul smell, but rarely with pus."
"Difficulty urinating, slow urine stream, thin stream",Phimosis,"What are the treatment options for phimosis? 1. For paraphimosis, manual reduction is attempted first; if unsuccessful, an emergency dorsal slit surgery is performed. 2. Generally, circumcision is employed for treating phimosis, indicated for: a) Fibrotic narrowing bands around the preputial orifice, b) Recurrent episodes of balanoposthitis, c) Narrowing of the preputial orifice in individuals older than 6 years. It is particularly emphasized that circumcision should not be performed on patients with buried penis; instead, preputioplasty should be considered. In cases where surgery is not an option, maintaining hygiene by frequently cleaning and retracting the foreskin is advised. Our department has extensive and mature experience in treating this condition."
"Prolonged fever, excessive sweating, joint pain, hepatosplenomegaly",Brucellosis,"Treatment options for Brucellosis include: 

 Pharmacotherapy: 

1. Acute phase treatment should be primarily antimicrobial. Since Brucella is an intracellular parasite, the antimicrobial agents must easily penetrate cell membranes to be effective. Consequently, in vitro drug sensitivity tests sometimes do not correlate with clinical efficacy. To prevent drug resistance and relapse, treatment usually requires a lengthy course of combined medications. 

 a) Common treatment regimen for adult brucellosis includes Doxycycline combined with Streptomycin: Brucella remains highly sensitive to Tetracyclines, with MIC generally <1mg/L, making this combination one of the most effective treatments to date. Doxycycline is administered at 2g/d, in four divided doses, for six weeks. Streptomycin is given at 1g/d, by intramuscular injection, for 2 to 3 weeks, with a relapse rate <5%. 

 b) Rifampicin combined with Doxycycline: Rifampicin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic with good cell membrane penetration due to its liposoluble action, even crossing the blood-brain barrier, can achieve concentrations inhibitory to Brucella when taken orally. A regimen of Doxycycline (0.2g/d) combined with Rifampicin (600–900mg/d), orally once daily for six weeks, is suggested. 

 c) Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim (Co-trimoxazole) combined with Streptomycin: These medications are administered as per the dosages mentioned above for a three-week course. 

 d) Ofloxacin combined with Rifampicin: Quinolone antibiotics, especially Ofloxacin, show good activity against Brucella in vitro. A recent study from Turkey reported that a combination of Ofloxacin (400mg/d) with Rifampicin (600mg/d) for six weeks could achieve similar efficacy to the Doxycycline-Rifampicin regimen. 

2. For children under 8 years old and pregnant women, Tetracyclines are not suitable due to the potential for inhibiting bone growth and crossing the placental barrier. Alternatives include a combination of Rifampicin with Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim or Gentamicin for 7 days or Netilmicin for 7 days. 

3. Short-course treatments have higher relapse rates. Strategies that include adopting sensitive blood culture methods are essential for accurately assessing drug efficacy against Brucellosis because some patients may test positive in blood cultures without showing any signs or symptoms. 

4. For neurobrucellosis and endocarditis due to Brucella, the above treatments may be applied, ensuring drugs capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier are used, and extending the duration of treatment as necessary. In some cases, valve replacement surgery is necessary along with prolonged antibiotic therapy for Brucella endocarditis. 

5. Chronic phase treatment for active chronic cases still typically involves antimicrobial therapy together with bacterin therapy. For relatively inactive cases, treatment is primarily bacterin therapy and symptomatic treatment. 

6. Surgical treatment, especially for purulent lesions, involves surgical drainage. Brucella osteomyelitis requires thorough debridement combined with long-term antimicrobial therapy. 

 Prognosis: The prognosis for Brucellosis is good. Untreated, the mortality rate is about 2%–3%. With antibiotic treatment, deaths are rare. Endocarditis, severe neurological complications, and pancytopenia are the main causes of mortality. Most patients in the acute phase recover within 3 to 6 months, though some cases may last longer than a year. Chronic phase treatment can be more challenging, sometimes resulting in joint deformities and tendon contractures, limiting limb mobility. However, with appropriate antimicrobial therapy, a good prognosis can be expected."
"Liver Qi stagnation, dark spots, Qi stagnation and blood stasis, blood deficiency, depression",Melasma,"What are the treatment methods for melasma? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The treatment of melasma with acupuncture has been employed in recent years, utilizing body acupuncture, auricular acupuncture and acupoint injection methods, which have shown good results. 
 
【Treatment】 
 
Comprehensive method 
 
(1) Acupoint Selection 
 
Primary acupoints: Divided into 3 groups. 1. Dazhui, Quchi, Xuehai, Zusanli, Sanyinjiao, Fengyan. 2. Shenmen, Sympathetic, Adrenal gland, Endocrine, Subcortex, Lung, Liver, Kidney (all auricular points). 3. Feishu, Xinshu, Ganshu, Shenshu. 
 
Matching acupoints: For headache and dizziness, irritability add Xingjian; for cold limbs and back pain, add Taixi, Mingmen, Shenmen, Neiguan; for irregular menstruation, reduced sexual function add Rugen, Zhongji; for palpitations, difficulty breathing, poor appetite add Neiguan; for itchy skin add Jiaji points with transverse needling. 
 
Fengyan acupoint location: Slightly in front of the midpoint of the line connecting the lower end of the earlobe with the posterior hairline. 
 
(2) Treatment method 
 
This method employs a combination of body acupuncture, auricular acupuncture, and acupoint injection. The first group of points and matching points are used for body acupuncture. Main acupoints are mandatory for each treatment, with matching points added as necessary. After achieving deqi via straight insertion, perform lifting-thrusting with slight twisting, the lifting-thrusting amplitude is 3-4mm, twisting frequency 60 times/min, mainly using tonifying and reducing techniques, with matching acupoints being tonified or reduced according to the severity of conditions. Withdraw the needle without retention after 1-2 minutes of manipulation. The second group of points is for auricular acupuncture, using 5-minute needles, selecting 2 points on each side per session, insert until deqi is felt and instruct the patient to press the needle handle once every half hour to enhance stimulation, leaving the needle for 4 hours before removal. The third group involves acupoint injection. The medication includes single herb injections of Angelica, Salvia miltiorrhiza, and Ligusticum chuanxiong; select based on symptoms; for blood deficiency use Angelica injection, for blood stasis use Chuanxiong injection, for liver Qi stagnation combined with blood stasis use Salvia injection, additionally, for those with deficiency, placental injection or vitamin B12 can be injected. Choose two points (both sides) for each session, injecting 0.5-1ml of medication per point. During injection, follow muscle injection protocols, injecting slowly once a sour, swelling, heavy sensation is felt at the acupoint. For significant skin itching, change to using 4ml of Vidin calcium gel, injected at Dazhui, Quchi, Xuehai. Body acupuncture, auricular acupuncture, and acupoint injection should be performed on the same day, every other day, with 10 sessions constituting one course of treatment. Interval 3-4 days between courses, after 5-6 courses, pause treatment for half a month, usually requiring 20-25 courses in persistence."
"Hematochezia, changes in bowel habits, incomplete defecation, tenesmus",Colorectal Cancer,"What are the treatment methods for colorectal cancer? Treatment Methods: 

The treatment of colorectal cancer primarily involves a multimodal approach, including surgical intervention, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. 

1. Surgery remains the cornerstone for colorectal cancer treatment, which can be categorized into curative and palliative surgeries based on the treatment objectives. 

2. Radiation therapy is particularly relevant for rectal cancer; it enhances local control and reduces the risk of recurrence. Preoperative radiation therapy contributes to an increased resection rate and preservation of anal function, while postoperative radiation therapy further diminishes the recurrence rate. 

3. The significance of chemotherapy in treating colorectal cancer is multifaceted: preoperative chemotherapy can shrink tumors, increasing the surgical resection rate; postoperative chemotherapy serves as an adjunct to surgery, aiming to eliminate residual cancer cells to reduce recurrences and metastasis, thereby achieving curative goals for colorectal cancer; For advanced stages, chemotherapy acts as a palliative treatment, improving the patient's quality of life and extending survival. 

4. Targeted therapy represents a novel and proven effective treatment methodology. By targeting specific molecular sites unique to cancer cells, anticancer drugs exert their effects, minimizing the impact on healthy tissues. Compared to traditional chemotherapy, targeted therapy exhibits milder side effects. 

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers three major therapeutic effects in treating small intestine cancer: 

1. Reducing cancerous tumors - This involves a series of anticancer drugs that possess qualities such as clearing heat, detoxifying, activating blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis, softening hardness, dissipating masses, transforming phlegm, and eliminating dampness. After treatment, tumors can soften, diminish in size, and ultimately disappear. 

2. Alleviating cancer pain - Cancer, especially in the advanced stages or after metastasis or spread, can cause pain, sometimes severe. The main causes of pain are the tumor's traction on or direct compression of surrounding nerves, traction on organ serosa by the tumor, and the invasive and destructive penetration of tissue organs by cancer cell toxins, which stimulate nerves. The series of anticancer drugs effectively relieve tumor pain by killing cancer cells and reducing tumors, thereby being highly effective and thorough without addiction or rebound. 

3. Eliminating fluid accumulation - Cancer cells invading the meninges, pleura, or peritoneum can lead to the formation of hydrocephalus, pleural effusion, or ascites. Traditional treatments like fluid drainage or diuresis address the symptoms rather than the cause. Anticancer drugs in TCM can strengthen the spleen and stomach, nourish qi and blood, enhance the body's immunity, and promote a balance in the body's fluid metabolism, tackling the root cause of hydrocephalus, pleural effusion, or ascites. Once the fluid accumulation is resolved, recurrence and rebound are generally not an issue."
"Redness, pain, tongue movement impairment, drooling, trismus",Submandibular Space Infection,The treatment for Submandibular Space Infection involves maintaining oral and dental hygiene and actively treating all types of oral inflammations to prevent the spread of infection.
"Pain in the liver area, fatigue, anorexia, abdominal distension, hepatomegaly, malnutrition, biliary cirrhosis, emaciation, abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, indigestion, diarrhea",Clonorchiasis,"What are the treatment methods for Clonorchiasis? 
General treatment for severe cases should initially focus on symptomatic and supportive care, such as improving nutrition, correcting anemia, and diuretic edema reduction. Once the overall condition improves, anthelmintic treatment is administered. In rare cases of large-scale infection, symptoms of acute Clonorchis sinensis infection such as chills, high fever, pain in the liver area, mild jaundice, elevated transaminases, and a significant increase in eosinophils may occur. Clonorchiasis is prevalent worldwide, including 24 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in China, such as Guangdong, Shandong, and Henan.

(1) Praziquantel is the first-choice drug for treating this disease, characterized by its short treatment duration, high efficacy, low toxicity, mild reactions, and fast absorption, metabolism, and excretion in the body. It should be taken for two consecutive days. Three months after treatment, the rate of fecal egg conversion to negative exceeds 90%. Few cases may experience adverse reactions such as dizziness, headache, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, which can decrease or disappear after 24 hours. The general dose does not cause significant damage to liver or kidneys. Rarely, premature contractions and arrhythmias may occur in individual patients. 
(2) Albendazole has been clinically used in recent years to treat this disease with satisfactory results. It is taken in two doses over a seven-day course. The rate of fecal egg conversion to negative is nearly 100%. 
2. Symptomatic treatment 
For severe infections accompanied by significant malnutrition or cirrhosis, nutritional support and correction of anemia are necessary to protect the liver and improve overall conditions, coupled with timely anthelmintic treatment. For concurrent cholecystitis and cholangitis, anthelmintic therapy is supplemented with antibacterial drugs. Acute cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, and common bile duct obstruction require surgical intervention. In cases of concomitant viral hepatitis, liver protection measures should be taken with anthelmintic treatment initiated as soon as the condition improves."
"Early pregnancy abdominal pain, inevitable miscarriage, abdominal pain accompanied by vaginal bleeding during pregnancy, pregnancy reaction",Ectopic Pregnancy,"The treatment options for ectopic pregnancy include: Salpingectomy is appropriate for emergency cases with internal bleeding and shock, and for patients without a desire for future fertility. For young women desiring future pregnancies, a salpingostomy may be performed."
"Intellectual disability, progressive neurological symptoms such as seizures, hyperactivity, spastic tetraplegia, general weakness, aggressive behavior",Mucopolysaccharidosis Type III,"The treatment for Mucopolysaccharidosis Type III is currently limited as there are no specific remedies. Treatments have included the use of α-L-iduronidase derived from bacteria, which has been found to decrease glycogen in the liver according to Hug and others. Rymn and colleagues have achieved positive results in treating infantile cases with liposomes containing maltase. Trials using purified α-glucosidase have also resulted in reduced liver glycogen. 
Prognostically, the infantile form often results in death within the first year of life; the juvenile form progresses slower and may lead to death due to recurrent respiratory infections, yet some patients may live beyond 20 years; the prognosis for adult forms is relatively better."
"Intense itching of the vulva, increased pain after scratching, varying extents of lesions, mainly affecting the labia majora, interlabial sulci, and clitoral prepuce, often presenting symmetrical lesions, thickened skin resembling leather with wrinkles, scales, eczematous changes, and the surface color being mostly dark red or pink with interspersed clearly bounded white patches",Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus,"Treatment options for Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus include: 

1. Elimination of inducing factors: For those with diabetes, trichomonal or fungal vaginitis, treatment should be administered, consumption of spicy food should be reduced, vulvar hygiene should be maintained, soap washing, scratching, and the use of irritating drugs should be avoided, and various vitamins, sedatives, and desensitizers may be taken. 

2. Topical medication aimed at relieving itching, reducing inflammation, moisturizing, and improving local nutrition includes: 

     a. External washes with herbal solutions such as Sophora flavescens and Artemisia capillaris. 

     b. For atrophic type: Use of 1% to 2% testosterone propionate ointment in cod liver oil (100~200mg testosterone propionate added to 20% cod liver oil ointment, 10~20g) applied externally 3-4 times/day for 2-3 months can thicken and soften the skin and resolve adhesions. 

     c. For hypertrophic and mixed types, application of dexamethasone or hydrocortisone cream, with mixed types also requiring testosterone propionate in cod liver oil ointment. 

3. Acupuncture and acupoint injection may be tried. 

4. Laser therapy: Effective in treating sclerosis lichen malnutrition types, providing pruritus relief, promoting ulcer healing, and improving local blood circulation. 

5. Surgical treatment: For moderate to severe atypical hyperplasia, or ulcers and fissures that do not heal after a long period of non-surgical treatment, simple vulvectomy can be considered."
"Dysphagia, retrosternal pain, persistent pain in the upper middle abdomen, food reflux, weight loss, bleeding",Achalasia,"The treatment options for achalasia include pharmacologic measures aimed at reducing vagal nerve excitability, such as the use of atropine, scopolamine, glaucine, or ergotamine and trihexyphenidyl to decrease the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure and alleviate pain and dysphagia. However, the effectiveness of pharmacologic treatment is generally poor. Currently, mechanical dilation or surgical methods are employed. 
Mechanical dilation can achieve good results in cases with less severe pathology when applied with proper force and pressure, but repeated treatments may be required to maintain efficacy. 
Surgery is considered a more ideal treatment option, with the modified Heller's myotomy being the most commonly used technique. This procedure involves a longitudinal incision through the circular muscle layer to the submucosa on the anterior wall of the lower esophagus, allowing the mucosa to bulge. Approximately 94% of patients experience relief from dysphagia postoperatively, and 3% of patients develop reflux esophagitis after surgery."
"Dizziness, fainting, palpitations, panic, trembling, sweating",Panic Disorder,"Treatment options for Panic Disorder generally involve a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. 

1. General Psychotherapy: Including psychoeducation, psychological support, and reassurance can be effective for milder symptoms. The treatment aims to reduce the patient's anticipatory anxiety and encourage them to re-enter feared situations. 

2. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): Primarily focuses on eliminating avoidance behavior, predominantly through exposure therapy. Depending on the case, systematic desensitization or flooding, along with response prevention techniques, are utilized. Both imaginal exposure and in vivo exposure are forms of exposure therapy, starting with imaginal exposure in severe cases. This involves guiding patients to imagine feared places or situations, addressing their anxiety responses, anticipatory anxiety, and avoidance behavior, while providing relaxation training until anxiety and tension are alleviated. Patients are then encouraged to enter real-life exposure, with repeated practice until satisfactory results are achieved. 

3. Pharmacotherapy: The use of certain anxiolytics and antidepressants. 

   (a) Anxiolytics: Such as benzodiazepines including Alprazolam, Lorazepam, Clonazepam, and non-benzodiazepines like Buspirone. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Fluoxetine, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (Venlafaxine), and serotonin enhancers like Trazodone are commonly prescribed. Oral Alprazolam 1.2 – 2.4mg/day, or Buspirone 15 – 45mg/day are typical dosages. 

   (b) Antidepressants: Options include oral Amitriptyline 150 – 250mg/day, or Imipramine 45 – 90mg/day. 

   (c) For performance anxiety in artists or teachers, Beta-blockers like Propranolol (20mg) taken 0.5 – 2 hours before performing or entering public spaces can significantly reduce symptoms like palpitations, tremors, and shaking due to fear. 

4. Agoraphobia Treatment: The principle is first to rule out depressive disorders. The treatment scheme for agoraphobia outlined combines behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, and pharmacotherapy, aiming to reduce avoidance behaviors and anticipatory anxiety through specific CBT and general psychotherapy, and when necessary, medication."
"Limb numbness, pain, redness, and localized skin pallor",Meralgia Paresthetica,"Following a definitive diagnosis, treatment for Meralgia Paresthetica should be tailored according to the specific cause. For cases resulting from local scar tissue proliferation or fascial compartment constriction, conservative measures such as rest and physical therapy are recommended. If these measures prove ineffective, surgical exploration may be undertaken to remove the compressive elements, including fascial compartment release and excision of perineural scar tissue. In instances where the nerve is deformed by compression, exhibits a hardened texture upon palpation, or if the pain is severe, neurolysis surgery should be considered to relieve the nerve."
Swelling and pain in the elbow,Radial Head Fracture,"What are the treatment options for a radial head fracture? Western medicine treatment methods include: Surgical treatment For non-displaced cartilaginous injuries or cracks in the radial head, the elbow joint can be immobilized with a plaster cast at a 90° position for 3-4 weeks. For displaced fractures, an attempt should be made for manual or leverage reduction; if unsuccessful, open reduction and internal fixation may be performed. 1. Manual reduction: An assistant maintains the affected limb in an extended elbow position or straight internal rotation, while the operator uses the thumb to press the fracture piece downwards back into place. After successful reduction, the elbow is immobilized at a 90° flexion with a plaster cast or a small splint for 3-4 weeks. 2. Percutaneous leverage reduction: For cases where closed reduction fails, under anesthesia, a Kirschner wire can be passed through the skin and brachial muscles to the fracture piece from above the elbow, on the lateral edge of the biceps brachii muscle. Under X-ray fluoroscopy, the position of the needle tip is adjusted to press down on the anterior and superior portion of the fracture piece for reduction. After successful reduction, immobilize with a plaster cast in a functional position for 3 weeks. 3. Open reduction and internal fixation: Suitable for dislocated fractures where the above methods fail. The operation uses a lateral or anterolateral approach to the elbow joint, exposing the fracture end and clearing the hematoma. After identifying the fracture fragments, they are pushed back into place. Before closing the incision, check if the concave surface of the radial head can stabilize the fracture piece when the elbow is flexed. If stable, internal fixation may not be necessary. For fractures with poor stabilization, fine steel pins can be used for fixation from the antero-lateral to postero-medial direction, and immobilized with a plaster cast for 3-4 weeks before removal of the pins for functional exercises. Large fracture fragments can also be fixed internally with cancellous bone screws from the dorsal side of the lateral humeral condyle (Figure 2), ensuring the screw tips do not penetrate the joint cartilage. Due to the strong and reliable fixation by the screws, functional exercises can begin 3-5 days post-operation. 4. Excision of fracture fragments: For small fragments that are difficult to fix, early removal of the fracture piece may facilitate joint mobility. For old dislocated fractures that hinder elbow flexion, excision of the fracture fragments or radial head is recommended to prevent traumatic arthritis, leading to pain and functional impairment."
"Pain, numbness, and a burning sensation on the outer side of the thigh, pain below the anterosuperior iliac spine aggravated by exertion, and sour pain in the area.",Meralgia Paresthetica,"Treatment modalities for Meralgia Paresthetica vary based on the underlying cause. Conservative treatment, including rest and physical therapy, is recommended for cases caused by local scar tissue proliferation or fascial compartment syndrome. If conservative management is ineffective, surgical exploration may be considered to alleviate compression by removing scar tissue and incising the fascial compartment. In instances where the nerve is deformed, feels hard upon palpation, or if pain symptoms are severe, neurolysis surgery should be performed to release the nerve."
"skin swelling, skin suppuration, skin necrosis, fever, systemic toxic symptoms",Pyoderma Gangrenosum,"Upon definitive diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum, immediate initiation of oral corticosteroids at high doses (1–3 mg/kg) or pulse therapy with methylprednisolone (1g/d for 5 days, dissolved in 150 ml of 5% glucose solution for intravenous drip over 1 hour) is recommended. For some cases, adjunctive treatments with Salazopyrin, sulfapyridine, or cytotoxic drugs may be beneficial. Salazopyrin, which possesses antibiotic, immunosuppressive, and anti-prostaglandin properties, is administered at a dosage of 4–6g/d. Intralesional injections of dexamethasone, although variably effective, can be considered. Synthetic resin dressings can be applied over draining lesions. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may reduce pain and accelerate healing. There have been successful treatments with potassium iodide. Pentoxifylline, which has anti-TNF properties, is also a viable option. Concurrent diseases must be managed accordingly, including the use of melphalan for myeloma. Cyclosporine at a dose of 10 mg/(kg·d) and chlorambucil 200–400 mg/d may be used for disease control. In the absence of secondary infection, local treatment should be gentle and symptomatic. Some cases with concurrent intestinal disease do not respond well to colectomy. Minocycline 100 mg, twice a day, is particularly effective for subacute cases. Intravenous immunoglobulin, once popular 30 years ago, has been adopted again in recent practices."
"urticaria, abdominal pain, vesicles, abnormal pigmentation, papules, fever, rash, edema",Eosinophilia,"The treatment options for eosinophilia include: 
1. For reactive or secondary causes, addressing the primary condition is most crucial. 
2. For idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (IHES), the first-line treatment is corticosteroids. In cases of steroid resistance, it may be necessary to add or switch to cytotoxic drugs such as hydroxyurea, cyclophosphamide, or mepolizumab, taking care to monitor for adverse reactions like bone marrow suppression. If steroid treatment fails, alpha-interferon could be considered. Other treatment modalities include IL-5 monoclonal antibody, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and cyclosporine A. 
3. For patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders having PDGFRA gene abnormalities, imatinib has shown nearly a 100% effectiveness rate. The dosage used is generally lower than that for chronic myeloid leukemia but requires long-term maintenance therapy."

    1. Central Type: Artificial mechanical ventilation with intermittent or continuous positive airway pressure, oxygen therapy, and pre-sleep administration of Acetazolamide 125-250mg can control symptoms.
    2. Obstructive Type:
        (a) General management: Oxygen therapy, avoiding the use of hypnotics, alcohol, androgens, and weight reduction.
        (b) Pharmacotherapy: Progesterone 20-30mg injected intramuscularly, twice daily for 2-3 weeks, has a stimulatory effect on the respiratory center. Acetazolamide 250mg orally, three times a day; Tricyclic antidepressants like Protriptyline 5-30mg before bed.
        (c) Medical Devices: Devices such as a tongue retaining device, orthodontic-like appliances, and nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) can control symptoms.
        (d) Surgical Treatment: Surgical intervention based on the different etiologies.
    3. Mixed Type: Treatment methods follow those of the Central SAS."
"Swelling and pain in the infraorbital area, swelling and pain in the masseter muscle and parotid gland area",Submandibular Space Infection,"The treatment for submandibular space infection primarily focuses on preventing asphyxiation and toxigenic shock. Depending on the severity of respiratory distress, a tracheotomy may be considered. Intravenous administration of high-dose antibiotics is employed to control the infection. Corticosteroids in moderate doses may also be used to improve the overall condition of the patient. Locally, incision and drainage should be performed as early as possible to reduce tension, eliminate pus and necrotic tissue, and prevent the excessive absorption of toxins that could worsen the condition. The incision for drainage can be made under local anesthesia, extending from one angle of the mandible to the other in an arcuate cut parallel to the lower edge of the mandible. Sometimes, a vertical incision resembling a “T” or “⊥” shape is made, with an incision through the platysma to widely separate each space, allowing pus to flow out. In cases of putrefactive necrotic infection, where the pus is thin, contains bubbles, and has a foul odor, and the soft tissue appears gray-black, irrigation with 3% hydrogen peroxide and saline followed by packing with hypertonic saline gauze for drainage is recommended."
"Multiple café-au-lait spots, tinnitus, radicular pain, hearing loss, pigmentation spots",Neurofibromatosis,"What are the treatment options for Neurofibromatosis? Neurofibromatosis is a hereditary, congenital disease, thus it cannot be completely cured with medication; symptomatic treatment is generally adopted. If neurofibromas grow rapidly and are accompanied by pain, or if there are symptoms of space-occupying lesions (such as scoliosis, headaches, etc.), surgery should be conducted as soon as possible; obstructed cerebrospinal fluid circulation can be treated surgically; facial sebaceous cysts can be managed with plastic surgery; symptomatic epileptic seizures can be controlled with antiepileptic drugs; patients experiencing unbearable radiating or burning pain should be treated with medication for neuropathic pain to reduce discomfort; increased intracranial pressure should be managed with diuretics to reduce intracranial pressure."
"Abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloating, fatigue, white segments in stools, nausea, anal itching",Taeniasis,"Treatment options for Taeniasis include: 1. Praziquantel administered in a single dose of 10–20 mg/kg for pork or beef tapeworm infections, and 15–25 mg/kg for infections by the dwarf tapeworm. No need for a purgative, and the effectiveness can reach over 95%. The drug acts on the tegument of the worm, causing vacuolization followed by rupture, and can induce spasms in the worm’s muscles, leading to its expulsion with intestinal peristalsis. For side effects of Praziquantel, refer to the section on Schistosomiasis. 2. Albendazole 400 mg, twice a day for a 3-day course of treatment, also achieves good efficacy. It is minimally absorbed by the intestine, resulting in fewer side effects."

Western medicine treatment for Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus, appropriate treatment can prevent 97% of cases from further deterioration. 1. Actively treat coexisting diseases, control blood sugar, correct endocrine disorders, and malnutrition, supplement vitamins, etc. 2. Local treatment includes keeping the vulvar area clean and dry, avoiding excessive washing with soap. For significant itching, topical corticosteroids such as Hydrocortisone Ointment, Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream may be used. For particularly severe itching, Clobetasol (Clobetasol Propionate) Cream or Ointment, or Betamethasone (Diprobase) Cream or Ointment may be applied with good effect. Keratotic proliferative lesions may be treated topically with 0.025%～0.05% Tretinoin Cream or 2.5% Fluorouracil Cream. It inhibits the transformation of deoxyuridine monophosphate into thymidylate monophosphate, suppressing DNA synthesis, causing tumor cell proliferation, division, and differentiation to halt, hence topical Fluorouracil Cream is used for treating precancerous skin lesions and malignant skin conditions. 3. Surgical removal is indeed not an absolute necessity for slight non-typical proliferation of vulvar leukoplakia as it can completely recover or alleviate through integrated traditional Chinese and Western medical treatments, without necessarily developing into squamous cell carcinoma. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the degree of non-typical lesions of vulvar leukoplakia. Usually, while undergoing integrated traditional Chinese and Western medical treatments, regular follow-ups are necessary. For persistent cases, surgery is considered a definite indication only when there is significant dyskeratosis with a tendency towards in situ carcinoma development."
"Delay in mental development, low intelligence",Intellectual Disability,"The treatment methods for intellectual disability encompass various strategies focusing primarily on enabling a supportive environment for the individual. Key approaches include: 

1. Genetic metabolic testing and counseling to prevent consanguineous marriages and guide couples with genetic disorders in family planning. 

2. Emphasizing the importance of timely childbirth, prenatal and perinatal healthcare, including amniotic fluid tests for chromosomal diseases, neural tube defects, metabolic diseases, managing high-risk pregnancies, intensive newborn care, advising pregnant women against alcohol and smoking, and avoiding drugs harmful to fetal development. 

3. Health education and nutritional guidance. 

4. Immunization against infectious diseases, viruses, bacteria, and parasites. 

5. Preventing infections and accidental injuries, reducing the risks of traumatic brain injuries and accidents, proper treatment of brain diseases, and controlling seizures. 

6. Enhancing early education and training, conducting regular health checks for preschool children, including physical, nutritional, mental, visual, and auditory development, and preventing neglect and abuse. 

7. Follow-up with high-risk newborns for early disease detection and treatment, emphasizing early nutrition (protein and essential minerals like iron and zinc), and environmental stimulation for intellectual development. Screening for metabolic diseases like hypothyroidism and phenylketonuria is crucial. 

In terms of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), treatment is tailored according to the underlying condition causing the disability. Approaches include activating blood circulation to remove stasis for conditions caused by trauma, such as intracranial hemorrhage, and supporting and nourishing the heart and kidneys, boosting essence and nourishing the marrow, and supplementing qi and blood for milder cases. For severe intellectual disabilities, focus is placed on replenishing essence, nourishing blood and marrow, strengthening the kidneys, with additional strategies to open the orifices and stimulate blood circulation. 

Western medical interventions aim at early diagnosis and intervention, including causal treatment, promoting or enhancing brain cell function, symptomatic drug treatment, and comprehensive rehabilitative treatments. While medication might be beneficial, especially for certain types of developmental delays with known causes, the primary reliance is on education and training to achieve a degree of independence in life skills and reduce dependency on others. Mild cases are encouraged to be educated in regular schooling environments, whereas severe cases require focused care and nursing. "
"High fever, chills, muscle soreness, poor appetite, fatigue, restlessness, moaning, and shortness of breath",Pneumococcal Pneumonia,"What are the treatment methods for pneumococcal pneumonia? Generally, treatment modalities for bronchopneumonia can be referred. Since the majority of pneumococcal strains remain sensitive to penicillin, the use of penicillin G can generally result in a rapid cure. The common dosage is 50,000 to 100,000 units/(kg·d), or 600,000 to 1,000,000 units or more per day, administered intramuscularly or intravenously in four divided doses. For patients allergic to penicillin, erythromycin 100mg/(kg·d) can be administered intravenously until improvement is noted, after which oral administration is possible. Treatment should continue for 1 to 2 weeks, or for 3 to 5 days post defervescence. If there is no improvement after 2 to 3 days of penicillin treatment, consideration should be given to rare penicillin-resistant strains and a switch to other antibiotics may be necessary. Alternative medications can be chosen based on the sensitivity test results of pneumococcal strains cultured from throat swabs. Given that a specific etiological diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia often cannot be made within 24 hours, broad-spectrum antibiotics are utilized to treat pneumonia of unknown etiology, with recent years seeing an increase in the use of first and second-generation cephalosporins such as cefazolin, cefalotin, and cefuroxime. For cases presenting with septic shock or manifestations of cerebral edema or herniation, resuscitation as described in the sections on septic shock or intracranial hypertension should be pursued. For late-presenters, common complications such as empyema, lung abscess, pericarditis, myocarditis, and toxic hepatitis should be promptly treated. Empyema requires puncture and pus drainage. Pneumococcal organisms do not produce true exotoxins, and their capsular polysaccharide antigens do not cause tissue necrosis, thus lobular pneumonia typically does not result in residual lung damage. However, scars left in the lungs by multilobar pneumonia may occasionally lead to chronic restrictive lung disease.

Western Medicine Treatment:

(1) Antibacterial treatment:

Treatment with antibacterial agents should commence immediately upon diagnosis, without waiting for bacterial culture results. Penicillin G is the first choice, with the route of administration and dosage depending on the severity of the disease and the presence of complications: For adults with mild disease, 2.4 million U/day can be administered intramuscularly in three divided doses, or procaine penicillin 600,000 U every 12 hours intramuscularly. For patients with moderate disease, Penicillin G 2.4 to 4.8 million U/day should be administered via divided intravenous infusions every 6 to 8 hours; for severe cases and those complicated by meningitis, the dosage may be increased to 10 to 30 million U/day, administered via four divided intravenous infusions. For patients allergic to penicillin, or infected with penicillin-resistant or multidrug-resistant strains, respiratory fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins like cefotaxime, or macrolides such as erythromycin may be used, with vancomycin or linezolid for multidrug-resistant strain infections. 

(2) Supportive therapy: 

Patients should rest in bed, ensuring adequate intake of protein, calories, and vitamins whilst closely monitoring for changes in condition and preventing shock. For severe chest pain, a small dose of pain relief medication, such as codeine 15mg, may be considered. Aspirin or other antipyretics should not be used to avoid excessive sweating, dehydration, and interference with the genuine fever pattern, which could lead to misjudgment. Encourage consumption of 1-2L of water daily; routine intravenous fluids are not needed for patients with mild illness unless dehydration occurs, in which case rehydration is necessary to maintain urine specific gravity below 1.020 and serum sodium below 145mmol/L. Patients with moderate to severe illness (PaO2<60mmHg or cyanosis) should be provided with oxygen. If significant paralytic ileus or gastric dilatation is present, food and drink should be temporarily prohibited, and gastrointestinal decompression should be applied until bowel movement resumes. For patients experiencing restlessness, delirium, or insomnia, consider using diazepam 5mg or chloral hydrate 1-1.5g; sedatives that suppress respiration are contraindicated.

(3) Management of Complications:

Fever often subsides within 24 hours of antibacterial treatment, or gradually decreases over several days. If the body temperature decreases and then rises again, or does not decrease after 3 days, extrapulmonary infections by pneumococci such as empyema, pericarditis, or arthritis, among other things, should be considered. Other causes of persistent fever may include penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), mixed bacterial infections, drug fever, or concurrent diseases. Although pneumonia may resolve after treatment, recurrence of pneumonia is possible if the obstructive factor, such as a tumor or foreign body in the bronchi, remains. About 10%-20% of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia develop pleural effusion and should be evaluated by pleural fluid analysis and culture as appropriate. If not treated properly, about 5% will develop empyema, which should be managed aggressively with pus drainage."
"Localized pain, swelling, fever, loss of appetite",Osteomyelitis,"The treatment options for osteomyelitis include surgical intervention to drain pus and remove necrotic tissue, thus exposing the infection to air as much as possible. This is often complemented with high-dose antibiotic therapy, with penicillin being the drug of choice, administered at a dosage of 2 to 6 million units per day for several months. Sulfonamides and iodides may be used in conjunction. Supportive care is provided for patients with poor general condition. Radiation therapy may also be considered for infections located in the facial and cervical areas."
"Dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms, retrosternal pain, persistent upper abdominal pain, achalasia of the cardia, cessation of peristalsis in part of the esophageal smooth muscle, weakened esophageal peristalsis, epigastric tenderness, weight loss",Achalasia,"What are the treatment options for achalasia? 
 1. Endoscopic Treatment: In recent years, with the advancement of minimally invasive concepts, new medical technologies and equipment have been continuously introduced. Endoscopic treatment for achalasia has been widely applied and achieved many new progresses. Traditional endoscopic treatments mainly include endoscopic balloon dilatation, stent implantation, botulinum toxin type A injection, and endoscopic myotomy with sclerotherapy. 
 2. Surgical Treatment: For moderate to severe cases and those not responding well to traditional endoscopic treatments, surgical intervention is warranted. Heller myotomy remains the most commonly used surgical method. This procedure can be performed either through the chest or abdomen, and can be done under thoracoscopy or laparoscopy. Postoperative complications mainly include reflux esophagitis; therefore, additional anti-reflux surgery is advocated by many, such as Nissen fundoplication (360-degree wrap), Belsey (270-degree wrap), Hill (180-degree wrap), or Dor fundoplication, where the fundus of the stomach is stitched around the esophagus's lower end and anterior wall. 
 3. Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM): POEM has achieved good outcomes in treating achalasia. This procedure does not require skin incisions; it involves cutting through the circular muscle layer of the cardia under endoscopy, maximizing the restoration of esophageal physiological functions and minimizing postoperative complications. Patients can resume eating soon after surgery, with 95% experiencing relief from dysphagia and a low incidence rate of reflux esophagitis. Given its short operation time, minimal trauma, rapid recovery, and reliable efficacy, POEM may currently be the best choice for treating achalasia."
"Recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, decreased muscle tone, abnormal sweating, growth retardation, developmental delay, abnormal psychomotor development in children, seizures, spinal and limb deformities",Mucopolysaccharidosis Type III,There is no specific cure for Mucopolysaccharidosis Type III. Treatments mainly involve surgical correction of skeletal deformities and the use of antibiotics to control infections.
"Visual impairment, retinal detachment, distorted vision",Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC),"The treatment options for Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC) vary and can be a topic of debate regarding timing and approach. Here are the primary treatments available: 
1. Medication: The exact cause of CSC is unknown, making targeted treatment difficult. Clinical practice has shown that corticosteroids can exacerbate the condition and lead to serous retinal detachment, thus their use is discouraged. Acetazolamide has been used to shorten the subjective vision improvement and edema resolution time without affecting the final visual acuity or recurrence rate. However, adverse reactions should be monitored. 
2. Photocoagulation: Laser photocoagulation therapy is a relatively effective, safe treatment with few complications. It can shorten the course of the disease and aid in vision recovery but does not reduce the recurrence rate. Treatment is advised 3-6 months post-diagnosis to avoid potential long-term distortion of vision due to prolonged retinal detachment. 
3. Photodynamic Therapy (PDT): For chronic or persistent CSC cases complicated by choroidal neovascular membranes (CNV), PDT can be considered. This involves the intravenous administration of verteporfin followed by laser irradiation. Studies have shown an improvement in vision and a reduction in leakage and choroidal capillary dilation. 
4. Surgical Treatment: For patients not responding to other treatments or who have central serous retinal detachment, vitrectomy may offer improvement by removing potential vitreoretinal traction and promoting the reabsorption of subretinal fluid. Modern microincision surgery techniques reduce complications and recovery times. It is critical to select patients carefully for this option based on criteria such as duration of CSC, extent of detachment, and visual acuity. 

CSC is essentially a self-limiting disease, and many cases resolve without intervention. However, for recurrences and chronic conditions, understanding and utilizing modern treatment options is key to improving patient outcomes and vision quality."

"Pallor, cold sweat, upper abdominal discomfort, hypotension, mental confusion, shortness of breath, nausea, fainting, proneness to fainting, collapsing episodes, fatigue, dizziness, tinnitus",Syncope,"What are the treatment methods for syncope? 
 1.Principles of management 
 (1)Protect brain function: Once syncope occurs, the patient should be immediately laid in a supine position and ensure the area is well-ventilated to maximize the blood and oxygen supply to the brain, preventing excessive cerebral ischemia and brain function damage. 
 (2)Treat the primary disease: Upon sudden onset of syncope, it's crucial to identify and manage the primary disease as soon as possible. A prompt diagnosis should be made to check for severe cardiovascular diseases, and if confirmed, appropriate measures, such as pacemaker implantation for syncope caused by complete atrioventricular block, should be taken to prevent cardiac arrest. 
 (3)Prevent complications: Some syncope patients may develop severe complications, such as trauma, which should be addressed cautiously. 
 2.Treatment measures 
 (1)General measures: Controlling the episode and identifying any life-threatening conditions are priorities when a patient experiences syncope. Basic management should include: 
 ①Position the patient with the head lower than the feet to ensure as much blood supply to the brain as possible. 
 ②Immediately check if the airway is clear, and monitor breathing and pulse. 
 ③Loosen any tight clothing. 
 ④If the patient regains consciousness quickly, they should remain lying down for a few minutes before standing, and then be observed for a few more minutes upon standing. 
 ⑤If the patient experiences syncope while hospitalized, blood tests for hematocrit, electrolytes, and blood glucose should be performed. 
 ⑥Carefully examine the patient for signs of trauma or other conditions following a fall after syncope. 
 ⑦Check for any life-threatening primary diseases, such as signs of acute bleeding or fatal arrhythmias. 
 (2)Treatment of the primary disease: After syncope occurs, it's essential to promptly identify and aggressively manage and treat the primary disease. 
 (3)Prevent recurrent episodes of syncope: Despite actively identifying and eliminating the causes of syncope, many patients still experience recurrent episodes, thus, prevention of further episodes is important. Main measures should include: 
 ①Eliminate triggers: Many patients' episodes of syncope have certain triggers such as prolonged standing, emotional fluctuations, or lack of sleep, which should be avoided. 
 ②Aggressively treat the primary disease: For patients with conditions like sick sinus syndrome who experience recurrent syncope, permanent pacemaker implantation may be necessary. 
 ③Change high-risk environments: Avoid high-altitude work, driving vehicles, etc."

"Swelling, heat, and pain of the prepuce and glans penis, worsened during urination, purulent secretion from the preputial orifice, phimosis, and difficulty in urination",Balanoposthitis,"Treatment of Balanoposthitis includes both Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Western medicine approaches. 

In TCM, treatments are categorized into three types based on the clinical manifestations: toxic heat accumulation, damp-heat generating worms, and deficiency of liver and kidney yin. 

1. For toxic heat accumulation, presenting with swelling and redness of the prepuce and glans, as well as possible rash, papules, vesicles, or ulceration, treatment focuses on clearing heat, draining fire, and detoxification. A common formulation is modified Dao Chi Dan, including ingredients such as Coptis Chinensis 10g, Scutellaria baicalensis 10g, Gardenia jasminoides 10g, Akebia quinata 10g, Rehmannia glutinosa 10g, Lophatherum gracile 10g, Alisma plantago-aquatica 10g, Rheum palmatum 6g, and Glycyrrhiza uralensis 10g, taken daily. 

2. For damp-heat generating worms, indicated by erythema and erosion or vesicles on the glans penis, pain, and fungal or trichomonas infections, treatment aims to clear heat, eliminate dampness, kill parasites, and relieve itching. A commonly used formula is modified Long Dan Xie Gan Tang, with ingredients such as Gentiana scabra 10g, Bupleurum chinense 10g, Coptis chinensis 10g, and others. 

3. For deficiency of liver and kidney yin, manifesting as patches or thickening, or sclerosis of the prepuce and glans without much itching or pain, treatment focuses on nourishing the liver and kidney. A typical prescription is modified Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. 

In Western medicine, treatment for balanoposthitis and complications such as phimosis and difficulty urinating may include: 

1. Early circumcision. 

2. Genital washing with 1:5000 potassium permanganate solution one to six times daily, for 30 minutes each time. 

3. Use of antibiotics. 

4. Dorsal slit of the prepuce if there's poor drainage. 

For allergenic balanoposthitis, discontinue the allergenic drug, apply hydrocortisone cream locally, and take antihistamines. 

Postoperative care includes encouraging timely urination to prevent urinary retention, adhering to prescribed medication for inflammation, taking sedatives before bed for 2-3 months post-surgery, especially for younger individuals, and taking estrogen to minimize pain and bleeding caused by erections. Keeping the perineal area clean and avoiding scratching are crucial to prevent local infection."
"Papules, pinpoint bleeding, erythroderma, pruritus, pustules, psoriatic arthritis, asymmetrical joint pain, widespread erythematous infiltration with scaling, extensive skin shedding, fever",Psoriasis,"Treatment options for psoriasis include: 
Topical Treatments 
Calcineurin Inhibitors: To date, there is no evidence supporting the effectiveness of calcineurin inhibitors when used alone for psoriasis treatment. Currently, calcineurin inhibitors are not approved for the treatment of psoriasis and should be considered off-label. However, studies have shown that calcineurin inhibitors are effective in hormone-sensitive skin areas such as the face, skin folds, and anogenital regions. Thus, tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream can be a rational addition for treating psoriasis in these specific areas with an initial dosage of 1-2 times per day, which can be adjusted based on individual conditions. When using tacrolimus ointment for facial treatment, start with a 0.03% concentration, gradually increasing to 0.1% over time, with an onset of action around 2 weeks. Pregnant or nursing women, patients with skin infections, and those on immunosuppressive therapy should avoid use. Adverse reactions include a burning sensation and skin infections. It should not be combined with phototherapy, and patients should apply sun protection. 
Corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroids are reliable in treating mild to moderate psoriasis, and their efficacy can be enhanced when used in combination with salicylic acid. Combining them with other systemic or topical treatments can also increase the clearance rate of lesions. The most common combination treatment involves topical Vitamin D3 analogs. There are no severe medication-related adverse effects during the induction period, but attention should be paid to potential local side effects such as skin atrophy and telangiectasia, especially in sensitive areas, with an initial dosage of 1-2 times per day, and efficacy typically noted within 1-2 weeks. Use is contraindicated in patients with skin infections, rosacea, perioral dermatitis. 
Tar: Clinical use of tar, often in conjunction with phototherapy, has not been substantiated as effective for psoriasis treatment, and its odor and color make it less acceptable for patients; thus, it is not recommended for psoriasis treatment. It may be used in combination with UVB for particularly stubborn cases of psoriasis, with topical application of 5%-20% tar ointment once daily, not exceeding 4 weeks. The onset of action is generally 4-8 weeks, and its efficacy may be enhanced when used with UV. Contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation. 
Anthralin: As one of the oldest topical treatments, anthralin is still used for mild to moderate psoriasis, either as a monotherapy for outpatient settings or as part of combination therapy for inpatient cases of moderate psoriasis. The treatment is safe, though skin irritation, burning sensation, erythema, and dyschromia may occur, without systemic drug reactions. A 0.5% anthralin application can be used for long-term treatment, or 1% for short-term use, with doses increased gradually if tolerated, twice daily. The treatment should complete within 4 weeks, with an onset of action around 2-3 weeks. It is not advised for use in acute erythrodermic psoriasis, pustular psoriasis. More severe cases may benefit from combination with phototherapy or other topical preparations like vitamin D3 analogs. Local adverse reactions include burning sensation and erythema.
Tazarotene: When used in combination with topical corticosteroids, tazarotene can improve efficacy and reduce skin irritation with no severe drug-related adverse reactions. Avoid contact with unaffected skin to prevent irritation. Topical tazarotene is recommended for the treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis. Applying tazarotene in the evening and a corticosteroid in the morning can enhance efficacy and reduce irritation. Recommended starting dosage is 0.05% tazarotene cream once at night for 1-2 weeks, maintenance with 0.1% cream for an additional 1-2 weeks, onset within 1-2 weeks. Contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation. Adverse reactions include pruritus, burning sensation, erythema, and irritation. Avoid concurrent use of medications that can dry or irritate the skin.
Vitamin D3 Analogues: Research shows that after several weeks of treatment with Vitamin D3 analogs, 30% to 50% of patients with mild to moderate psoriasis experienced significant improvement or clearance of lesions. The use of topical Vitamin D3 analogs in the early stages of treatment can enhance efficacy and tolerability when combined with corticosteroids. For severe psoriasis, combining topical Vitamin D3 analogs with UV phototherapy and cyclosporine A can have a synergistic effect. Topical Vitamin D3 analogs are generally well-tolerated by both physicians and patients, although skin irritation at the site of application, particularly on the face and intertriginous areas, may limit their use. Recommended initial dosages are: Calcitriol: 1-2 times per day, body surface area (BSA) < 30%; Tacalcitol: once daily, BSA < 20%; Calcipotriene: twice daily, BSA < 35%. Maintenance doses: Calcitriol: 1-2 times per day, up to 100g per week can be maintained for a year; Tacalcitol: for the first 8 weeks once daily, can be maintained for 18 months, BSA < 15%, < 3.5g/day. Onset is approximately within 1-2 weeks. Contraindicated in patients with metabolic bone diseases, severe liver or kidney diseases. Adverse reactions include skin irritation symptoms (redness, itching, burning sensation). Avoid concurrent use of medications that elevate serum calcium levels (e.g., thiazide diuretics); using topical salicylic acid preparations or exposure to UV rays can deactivate Vitamin D3 analogs. 
Calcipotriene is recommended for the maintenance treatment of mild to moderate chronic psoriasis. Tacalcitol causes less skin irritation and is especially recommended for sensitive skin areas, such as the face.
Phototherapy: Phototherapy is a safe and effective treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis, with clinical effects observed within 2 weeks. Overexposure resulting in UV erythema is a common side effect, and repeated or long-term use may lead to premature skin aging, while the risk of tumors may be associated with oral PUVA treatments or local PUVA and UVB treatments. Practicality is limited by treatment location, financial considerations, patient factors, and the availability of time for both doctors and patients. 
Phototherapy is recommended for the induction treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis, especially those with extensive lesions, but the side effects of the various rays must be carefully weighed. The risk of skin cancer is greater after PUVA treatment than with UVB. Due to its low practicality, long-term treatment resulting in increased cumulative UV dosage can lead to adverse reactions, thus phototherapy is not recommended for long-term treatment, but combination with topical Vitamin D3 analogs can increase response rates. Excimer laser therapy is restricted to targeted treatment of individual lesions. 
Pregnant or nursing women should not use PUVA. Adverse reactions include erythema, itching, blisters, and malignancy, with nausea possible after PUVA treatment. Some medications can cause phototoxicity and photoallergic reactions. PUVA should not be combined with cyclosporine A. 
Traditional Systemic Treatments 
Cyclosporine: The recommended dosage is 2.5-3mg/kg, up to a maximum of 5mg/kg. After the induction treatment, maintenance therapy can be performed for a period of 8-16 weeks, reducing the dosage by 0.5mg/kg every 14 days. Before treatment, it is necessary to confirm whether the patient has had any serious infections, malignancies, kidney or liver diseases, or other diseases in the past, and whether they are on any other medication. Screening for malignancies, measuring blood pressure, looking for signs of infection in laboratory tests and physical examinations are also necessary. Contraception is required during treatment, but contraceptives containing progesterone may reduce the efficacy of cyclosporine, thus their use should be avoided. Concurrently, patients are advised to use sun protection to avoid excessive sun exposure. 
During treatment, careful inspection of the patient's skin and mucosa is necessary to check for increased body hair, gingival hyperplasia, and signs of infection as well as gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, and blood pressure should be monitored. Emphasize the importance of photoprotection and sunscreen application. For long-term treatments with 2.5-3mg/(kg·d), laboratory test intervals may be extended to once every 2 months. However, for patients with risk factors, increased dosages can lead to adverse absorption or drug interactions, so the interval between laboratory tests should be shortened. Some patients undergoing intermittent or short-term treatment may only need routine blood tests and creatinine monitoring. 
Clinical studies have shown that cyclosporine is quite effective for the treatment of adult psoriasis, with 50%-70% of patients achieving a PASI reduction of >75% after 12-16 weeks of treatment. Cyclosporine is mainly used for induction treatments, and long-term treatment should be carefully and individually assessed for its risk/benefit ratio, with adverse reactions including nephrotoxicity, hypertension, and increased risk of malignancies. Consideration of drug interactions is necessary, as cyclosporine treatment or combined with other treatments can lead to better outcomes but may also increase the risk of drug adverse effects. 
Cyclosporine is mainly recommended for the induction treatment of moderate to severe adult psoriasis patients and can be used for some patients' long-term treatment but should not exceed 2 years due to increased toxicity and reduced efficacy. Combined with topical medications, especially Vitamin D3 analogs or corticosteroids, can reduce the dosage of cyclosporine without reducing efficacy. 
Methotrexate (MTX): The starting dosage is 5-15mg/w, with the maintenance dose adjusted based on treatment response to 5-22.5mg/w, with an onset of action within 4-8 weeks. Contraindicated in pregnant or nursing women, alcoholics, those sensitive to MTX active ingredients, with abnormal bone marrow function, severe liver disease, severe infections, immunodeficiency, active peptic ulcers, hematologic changes (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), and renal failure. Adverse reactions include liver fibrosis/cirrhosis, pneumonitis/alveolitis, bone marrow suppression, reversible alopecia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, elevated transaminases, infections, gastrointestinal ulcers, nephrotoxicity. 
Before treatment, check for indications of chronic liver disease on the patient's skin. If there is a history of hepatitis or pathological changes are found during physical examination, a liver ultrasound should be performed. Laboratory tests should monitor the serum levels of type III collagen aminoterminal peptide (PⅢNP). Both men and women should use contraception during treatment, with regular laboratory tests conducted. When the long-term treatment cumulative dose reaches over 1.5g or liver damage is suspected, a liver disease specialist consultation should be requested to determine the need for liver biopsy. If fever, cough, dyspnea, and cyanosis are present, a chest X-ray should be performed to check for MTX pneumonia. To reduce toxicity, it's advised to take 5mg of folic acid daily on days not taking MTX. Carefully record the cumulative dosage during treatment. Contraception is required for 3 months post-treatment. 
MTX is recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis but its use is limited by contraindications and the need for extensive monitoring during treatment. MTX has a slow onset, so it is not recommended for short-term induction treatment but can be used for long-term treatment, and it is the cheapest systemic treatment option. After 16 weeks of MTX treatment, approximately 60%-75% of patients can achieve a PASI reduction of 75%. Clinical experience also demonstrates that the efficacy of MTX continues to increase with long-term treatment, making it the preferred medication for long-term treatment. However, its clinical application is limited by serious adverse reactions, especially hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal ulcers, and rare but very severe special reactions. 
Retinoids: The starting dosage is 0.3-0.5mg/(kg·d), which can be adjusted to 0.5-0.8mg/(kg·d) after 4 weeks, with the maintenance dose varying per individual, generally having an onset within 4-8 weeks. Contraindicated in individuals with kidney or liver damage, pregnant/nursing women, alcoholics, diabetics, those wearing contact lenses, with a history of pancreatitis, hyperlipidemia. Main adverse reactions include symptoms of vitamin A excess. Avoid concurrent use with phenytoin, tetracycline antibiotics, and methotrexate. 
Pregnant and nursing women should be informed of the teratogenic risks associated with treatment, requiring long-term and effective contraception and the signing of a written informed consent form. Query patients for any bone and joint pain and conduct necessary laboratory tests. 
After long-term treatment (approximately 1-2 years), radiographic examination of the spine and joints should be performed to rule out ossification. Women of childbearing age should practice contraception and abstain from alcohol for 2 years post-treatment. When used as a monotherapy for moderate to severe psoriasis, lower doses may not be satisfactory, while higher doses can increase efficacy but also raise the incidence of adverse reactions in skin and mucous membranes. Acitretin in combination with UV can produce a synergistic effect, but data on this treatment are limited. 
Biologic Treatments 
Etanercept: The starting dosage is 25mg, twice a week or 50mg, twice a week, with a maintenance dose of 25mg twice a week, generally effective within 4-8 weeks, with the latest onset by 12 weeks. General precautions before, during, and after etanercept treatment are consistent with those for efalizumab. After 12 weeks of treatment with etanercept at 25mg/dose, twice a week, 35% of patients can achieve a 75% reduction in PASI; at 50mg/dose, twice a week, 50% of patients can achieve a 75% reduction in PASI. Clinical experience shows that long-term treatment up to 24 weeks can maintain clinical efficacy. 
Etanercept is recommended for the induction treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis, especially in patients who have not responded well to or cannot tolerate/are contraindicated for other treatments. If psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis coexist, TNF-α antibody therapy is particularly recommended. 
Infliximab: The recommended dosage is 5mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6, followed by maintenance treatment every 8 weeks. Monitor the injection process and observe for 1-2 hours during the treatment period. Contraceptive measures should be maintained until 6 months post-treatment. 
Infliximab is among the most effective medications for treating psoriasis, with good long-term efficacy demonstrated by studies. However, various safety factors, particularly the risks associated with infusion reactions and serious infections, must be fully considered, necessitating careful assessment of indications and health education and supervision for patients. After 10 weeks of treatment with infliximab, 88% of moderate to severe patients can achieve a 75% reduction in PASI. 
Infliximab is recommended for the induction treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis, especially in patients who have not responded well to or cannot tolerate or are contraindicated for other treatments. If psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis coexist, TNF-α antibody therapy is particularly recommended. 
Other Treatments 
Climatotherapy/Balneotherapy: Bath and climate therapy have been successful in treating psoriasis for centuries, often combined with other treatments, but are not suitable for acute phase or short-term treatment. 
Socio-psychological Therapy: The advantage of socio-psychological therapy is its low adverse reaction rate. Through social and psychological therapy, direct or indirect effects on skin symptom improvement can be achieved.

"Lower back pain, sensory disturbances, gastrointestinal bloating, paralysis, persistent dull pain in the lower back",Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome,"Treatment for Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome involves addressing the underlying cause of obstruction, whether it be compression due to a specific reason, surgical injury, or other factors. The goal is to alleviate compression early through surgery or other effective measures to restore spinal cord blood supply as soon as possible. Once spinal degeneration occurs, it is often difficult to achieve a satisfactory recovery. 
Early surgery to relieve compression tends to have a reasonable recovery outlook. Delayed treatment can lead to ischemic necrotic changes in the spinal cord, resulting in serious complications such as paraplegia or even spinal shock leading to death."
"Neck and shoulder pain, hyperactive tendon reflexes, back pain, spinal and limb deformities, involvement of the motor conduction bundle, spina bifida, loss of spinal physiological curvature, sensory disturbances, referred pain, anterior horn lesions of the spinal cord, cervical spinal extradural lesions, ascending numbness of the skin",Spinal Cord Injury,"What are the treatment methods for spinal cord injury?
    The treatment of spinal cord injury should still adhere to the basic principles of fracture treatment, namely emergency aid, reposition, fixation, and functional exercise in this sequence. Open spinal cord injuries should first be converted to closed fractures, then treated according to the above principles; for those with severe comorbid injuries or complications, priority should be given based on the degree of life-threatening conditions.
    (1) Pre-hospital emergency aid: Like the emergency aid for any fracture, the pre-hospital emergency aid for patients with spinal fractures must be timely, properly measured, and in the correct order. This has a crucial impact on the treatment outcome. Therefore, the usual training and quality cultivation of on-site first-aid personnel must be emphasized.
    - Scene management: Except for emergency measures such as asphyxiation and major bleeding, the general situation mainly involves determining the injury site, the presence of paralysis, maintaining airway patency, and providing temporary fixation.
    A. Injury site: Can be determined based on the patient's complaint and a rapid top-to-bottom examination of the spine. During the examination, the patient should not be allowed to sit up or bend the spine forward; a simple left and right turn on the spot is sufficient.
    B. Presence of paralysis: Mainly determined by examinations of sensation, movement, and the presence of urinary or fecal incontinence in the limbs after the injury.
    C. Temporary fixation: It is best to use standard emergency equipment, such as an inflatable cervical collar, standard fixation stretcher (referring to the stretcher equipped on ambulances, which is rigid and suitable for spinal fractures), or other designed products. If there is no specialized equipment, hard stretchers, door panels, bed boards, or other materials that can stabilize the thoracolumbar region should be used for temporary fixation of the spine. When moving the injured to the stretcher, a 3-4 person flat lifting method should be employed, avoiding the incorrect method of two people or one person lifting, which can cause or exacerbate spinal cord injury.
    - Rapid transport to the hospital: Depending on the patient's injury condition and the proximity of hospitals, quickly transport the patient to a comprehensive or specialized hospital capable of further treatment. During the transfer, the patient's condition should be closely monitored, and emergency resuscitation should be provided if vital signs become critical. For cervical spine injuries, transport should be carried out using an inflatable cervical collar, a regular neck collar, sandbags, or under traction with a regular traction belt whenever possible. Abnormal activities such as excessive flexion, extension, or rotation of the spine that could cause or exacerbate spinal cord injury should be strictly avoided. During transport, the patient's trunk should move in sync with the rises and falls of the ambulance as much as possible.
    - Rapid examination in the emergency room: After the patient arrives at the emergency room, after ruling out other more severe cranial and thoracic or abdominal injuries, attention should especially be paid to respiration, bladder fullness, sensation in both lower limbs, knee reflex, and ankle muscle strength, which are representative. During X-ray filming, the patient should be kept in a supine position to avoid excessive turning.
    (2) Treatment principles for spinal cord injury: The treatment of all types of spinal injuries should follow the following principles:
    - Simple spinal fractures and dislocations: Should be treated according to the general principles of fracture and dislocation, viz., repositioning, fixation, and functional activity, while avoiding causing spinal cord injury.
    - Spinal fractures and dislocations with spinal cord injury: Initially, treatment should focus on facilitating the recovery and reconstruction of spinal cord function.
    - Principles of treating spinal cord injuries:
    A. If there is compression material around the spinal cord, it should be eliminated manually or surgically to relieve pressure on the spinal cord.
    B. For patients with spinal shock, non-surgical methods should be primarily adopted, with careful observation of changes in condition, avoiding arbitrary surgery.
    C. For patients with complete transverse spinal cord injuries, although decompression surgery is ineffective, for those with unstable fractures or dislocations, internal fixation of the injured vertebrae can obtain early opportunities for turning over and activity, thereby reducing secondary injuries locally.
    D. Early-stage injuries should be treated with dehydration therapy, including intravenous administration of dexamethasone and hypertonic glucose solutions, but attention should be paid to complications such as stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.
    E. Actively prevent various complications, especially paying attention to respiratory and urinary tract infections, bed sores, and the formation of venous thrombosis.
    F. For cervical spinal cord injuries, maintaining airway patency is essential. In principle, tracheotomy should be performed for injuries above C5, and other vertebrae should be treated as appropriate.
    G. Whole-body supportive therapy is particularly important for patients with high spinal cord injuries.
    H. A positive attitude and effective measures should be adopted for limb functional activities and reconstruction.
    I. Other non-surgical therapies, including hypothermia therapy, hyperbaric oxygen, and various neurotrophic drugs, can be selected as appropriate, but should not replace surgical methods."
"Galactorrhea, obesity, hyperpigmentation, menstrual disorders",Prolactinoma,"The treatment of prolactinomas relies on two factors: the size of the tumor and whether the presence of hyperprolactinemia is symptomatic. Dopamine agonists are the first-line treatment, with bromocriptine being primarily used domestically and cabergoline available internationally. Surgical intervention via the transsphenoidal approach can be considered if medication is ineffective or resistance occurs. Even with large adenomas causing neurological compression, initial treatment with dopamine agonists might quickly demonstrate effectiveness. Radiation therapy is only used as an adjunctive treatment. Regardless of the treatment approach, regular monitoring of prolactin levels (PRL) is essential. 
1. Medication: Dopamine agonists, as a leading treatment option, have over two decades of clinical observations showing significant effectiveness in lowering serum PRL levels, reducing tumor size, improving visual field defects and symptoms of neural compression, and restoring gonadal function. Recently, several new dopamine D2 receptor agonists have emerged, including pergoide, quinagolide, and cabergoline. 
2. Surgery: Mainly performed through the transsphenoidal approach, it involves the selective excision of adenomatous tissue through an oral or naso-sphenoidal route, while preserving normal pituitary tissue. However, complete removal may not be achievable for some patients, leading to possible postoperative complications such as cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, diabetes insipidus, intracranial infections, visual system damage, and reduced pituitary gland function. Surgery may reduce the need for medication, potentially improving drug resistance postoperatively. 
3. Radiation Therapy: It serves as an auxiliary means, preventing tumor growth; however, it has a slow effect on reducing PRL levels and unsatisfactory restoration of ovulatory menstrual cycles, often used for those not cured by surgery. Pituitary radiation's complications include hypothalamic dysfunction, pituitary function decline, damage to the visual system, cerebrovascular accidents, brain necrosis, and secondary malignant or benign brain tumors."
"Granuloma, Crusting",Pyogenic Granuloma,"What are the treatment methods for pyogenic granuloma? Treatment options include: 1. For mild cases, attention to nutrition, rest, and the local application of antibiotics may suffice. For larger or more numerous ulcers, systemic antibiotics such as erythromycin may be required. 2. The use of silver nitrate sticks followed by pressure bandaging or surgical removal is recommended. Topical antibiotic ointments can be applied locally. Traditional Chinese medicine treatments may include the external application of Hei Bu Hua Du Ointment and the oral intake of Xiao Chuang Drink. Prognosis: Ulcers may heal within weeks or months, leaving behind pigmented scars."
"Facial dysplasia, long bone growth disorder, delayed sexual development, and intellectual disability",Dwarfism,"Treatment methods for dwarfism encompass pharmacological therapy, hormone replacements, and, in cases triggered by intracranial tumors, surgical or radiation therapy. 

1. Growth Hormone (GH): Usage is strict and more effective at younger ages. Dosages involve recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) at 0.7U/kg, administrated daily via injection with a two-week on, two-week off cycle, eventually reducing the amount over several months and maintaining for 1-2, up to 5-6 years. Alternatively, a continuous dose of rhGH 0.12U/kg daily subcutaneous injections for a year could be administered. Initial usage often accelerates growth significantly in height and weight without apparent changes in epiphyseal or sexual maturation. Post-treatment, about 50% can achieve normal height. High-protein diets are recommended during the treatment. Since 1985, synthetic GHRH (groliberin) and genotropuin at 30-60μg/kg and 0.1U/kg respectively can be administrated subcutaneously before bedtime using a microinjection pump over six months, with 40%-80% of patients showing a response to GHRH stimulation. 

2. Androgens: Concurrent or premature use with GH treatment is discouraged due to potential early skeletal fusion. For those with poor GH response, synthetic anabolic steroids such as nandrolone phenylpropionate might be considered, especially when bone age is significantly less than chronological age, ideally 5 years behind. Treatment should commence at ages 8-12 for confirmed cases and after 14 for uncertain ones, with doses at 1-1.5mg/kg biweekly through intramuscular injections, for six months per cycle, with possible repetition following a 3-6 month break, conditional on bone age review. The treatment may promote height growth of approximately 10cm annually, alongside improvements in appetite, weight, muscle mass, stamina, and genital development, notable more in males than in females. 

3. Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (HCG): Generally considered when near puberty, with doses of 500-1000U, twice weekly by subcutaneous injections for six months, or 1000U every other day by muscle injection, adjusting to 500U twice weekly after 2 weeks for 3-4 months, benefiting gonadal and secondary sexual characteristics development. 

4. Thyroid agents: Indicated for concurrent hypothyroidism, possibly alongside nandrolone phenylpropionate in small doses (20-40mg/daily), to not undermine the effectiveness of GH. Routine use is discouraged. 

For dwarfism induced by intracranial tumors, surgical interventions through transcranial or transsphenoidal approaches followed by post-operative radiation therapy are advisable. Tumors smaller than 1cm2 might be treated with linear accelerator radiation or Gamma Knife therapy. 

Complementary treatments include prioritizing western pharmacy hormone therapy, supplemented with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) approaches for holistic care, aiming at promoting growth through growth hormones or anabolic steroids, hormone replacement for significantly reduced peripheral endocrine glands (thyroid, adrenal cortex, gonads) functionalities, and addressing intracranial tumors with surgical or radiation treatments. Pure TCM treatments may offer stable and ideal outcomes while minimizing side effects of western medications. TCM treatments are tailored based on symptomatic diagnosis, managing the condition, relieving symptoms, leading to gradual recovery, with a focus on lifestyle and wellness."
"Abdominal distension, thin and tight skin, pale complexion, difficulty urinating, and pain on both sides of the flanks",Ascites,"What are the treatment options for Ascites? In traditional Chinese medicine, Ginkgo (Bai Guo) is used, which can be mashed with its skin on to treat coughs, as its skin has the property to nourish the lungs; for promoting urination, it is advisable to remove the skin and then mash it for use, leveraging its smooth properties to facilitate downward movement. 
In Western medicine, treatment focuses on the underlying cause, which is often liver cirrhosis due to tissue structure disorder leading to liver dysfunction. There is currently no cure for cirrhosis. The main goal is early detection and halting disease progression to extend life and maintain labor capacity. 
1. During the compensatory stage of liver cirrhosis, once diagnosed, it's crucial to balance work and rest, adhere to appropriate treatment and diet with high-calorie, high-protein, vitamin-rich, and easily digestible foods, and strictly avoid alcohol. Use of drugs that may damage the liver should be avoided. Light work may generally be carried out. Regular follow-ups are necessary. 
2. In the decompensated stage, generally, the condition is more severe and rest or hospitalization may be required. Dietary management should focus on easily digestible, nutrition-rich foods, with appropriate high protein intake at 1.0–1.5g/(kg·d), appropriate high carbohydrates, low fat (with fat accounting for about 1/3 of the total caloric intake), with a daily total caloric intake of about 8000–10000J. In case of hepatic encephalopathy, protein intake should be limited to 0.5–1.0g/(kg·d) to prevent bleeding from esophageal varices rupture; spicy and hard foods should be avoided. Sodium and water intake should be restricted in the presence of ascites and edema. Liquid maintenance should be based on 24h urination volume and insensible losses, preferably keeping daily intake below 1500ml. 
Supplementation of vitamins is required to counter the deficiencies often present in cirrhosis, including vitamins B1, B2, C, B6, niacin (or nicotinic acid), folic acid, B12, A, D, and K. 
In the presence of active chronic hepatitis, controlling the hepatitis is necessary, possibly requiring antiviral and immunomodulatory treatments such as interferons and adenine arabinoside, with the use of corticosteroids like prednisone when necessary. 
Anti-fibrotic drugs have shown the potential to prevent liver fibrosis in animal studies, but their clinical use is limited and often comes with side effects."
"Conjunctival congestion, marginal corneal ulcer, and visual impairment",Pterygium,"Treatment options for pterygium vary based on its size and impact on vision. For small, stationary pterygium that does not affect vision, treatment is not necessary. If associated with trachoma or chronic conjunctivitis, antibiotic or corticosteroid eye drops such as 0.3% ofloxacin or 0.5% prednisolone can be applied 3 to 4 times daily. In cases where pterygium grows onto the cornea impairing vision, surgical treatment in a hospital is advisable. However, postoperative recurrence is high, and recurrent pterygium often progresses more rapidly and may be larger than the original, thus careful preoperative consideration and thorough surgery are essential to decrease the likelihood of recurrence. Common surgical methods include pterygium excision with conjunctival autograft and pterygium burial surgery. To prevent recurrence, postoperative beta radiation, drops of thiotepa, colchicine, or mitomycin C may offer some therapeutic benefits, though side effects should be monitored. The recurrence rate of progressive pterygium is high after surgery, and early postoperative application of 0.5% prednisolone eye drops, 4 to 6 times a day, is recommended. Corticosteroid drugs primarily aim to inhibit the neovascularization and fibroblast growth in the traumatized area, reduce postoperative inflammatory reactions, and granulation tissue formation without directly preventing recurrence. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) approach involves integrating systemic symptoms with local signs; with sharp-headed, red, thick pterygium with excessive tearing being considered as an excess condition, whereas a flat, white, thin pterygium indicates a deficient condition, differentiating between wind-heat, excess heat, and deficiency heat. Treatment should drain excess fire or clear deficiency fire accordingly, supplemented with topical applications of 'Babao' eye medicine or 'Hong Yan' powder on the pterygium. If the medication is ineffective and the pterygium grows rapidly, hook scraping surgery may be considered."
"Pain, numbness, tingling, burning, and weakness in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh.",Meralgia Paresthetica,"The treatment for Meralgia Paresthetica may involve managing underlying conditions such as diabetes, arteriosclerosis, and exposure to toxins. Weight loss in obese patients can reduce or eliminate symptoms. Vitamin B complex supplements may be beneficial. For severe pain, oral analgesics, sedatives, or carbamazepine can be administered. Injection therapy with Vitamin B1 100mg combined with 654-2 needle 10mg, or 2% procaine 5-10ml at the site where the nerve exits the fascia can be effective. Physical therapy, acupuncture, and massage may also provide relief."
"Dry stools, constipation, abdominal pain",Constipation,"What are the treatment methods for constipation? 
 1. For acute constipation, most cases are caused by intestinal obstruction, thus the treatment primarily focuses on addressing the cause. For patients experiencing abdominal distension and hidden abdominal pain, warm water enema can be administered; in cases of pathological obstruction, timely surgical intervention is required. 
 2. Constipation resulting from anal or rectal vicinity diseases, such as anal fissures, anal fistulas, perianal abscesses, and severe internal hemorrhoids with infection leading to acute constipation, requires active treatment of these conditions. Measures should also be taken to soften the stools or administer medication through the anus to facilitate bowel movements. 
 3. If acute constipation is caused by the side effects of medications known to induce constipation, a reduction or discontinuation of such medications may be necessary. Mild laxatives with minimal intestinal stimulation may be added if needed. 
 4. Chronic constipation due to organic lesions should be treated according to the identifiable cause once diagnosed. 
 5. For patients experiencing prolonged constipation, lasting over a year, or those with recurrent episodic constipation (or alternating between constipation and diarrhea), who have been confirmed through various examinations to have no organic lesions in the colon and rectum, are generally in good condition, have a normal appetite, and show no signs of wasting or anemia, intestinal motility dysfunction constipation or irritable bowel syndrome may be considered. Treatment for such patients generally proves challenging. The following measures may be attempted: 
   (a) Encouraging the patient to engage in feasible exercises, such as Tai Chi, gymnastics, jogging, or walking; advising the patient to lie flat on their back before sleep to perform abdominal exercises (deep abdominal breathing) for 15-30 minutes each time; and self-abdominal massage, preferably in a clockwise direction from the right side to the left side, lasting 15-30 minutes. 
   (b) Encouraging the patient to consume more vegetables high in fiber and fruits like bananas, pears, and watermelon to increase stool bulk, and advising increased water intake while reducing the consumption of beverages with strong stimulants such as strong tea and coffee. 
   (c) Advising the patient to frequently consume honey, which functions to moisten the intestines and facilitate bowel movements."
"Nodding, head shaking, neck stretching, torticollis, blinking, shrugging, pouting, trunk twisting, involuntary abdominal gyrations",Tourette Syndrome,"Treatment options for Tourette Syndrome include pharmacological and supportive approaches. Pharmacotherapy initially involves the administration of haloperidol, starting with a dose of 0.5–1mg twice daily. The dosage may be gradually increased to a daily therapeutic range of 2–8mg, with symptom improvement observed within 1–2 weeks of treatment. To mitigate extrapyramidal side effects, trihexyphenidyl 2mg per day can be adjunctively administered. Additionally, pimozide is an alternative treatment, initiated at low doses with gradual increment, targeting a therapeutic dose of 0.1mg three times a day. 

 Alternative treatments explored by researchers include protein powder, deep sea salmon oil capsules, natural group B vitamins, calcium magnesium tablets, and wheat germ oil capsules. Follow-up evaluations at six months, one year, and two years showed no relapse cases. Cranial CT and Transcranial Doppler (TCD) scans did not reveal any abnormalities. These treatments not only provide high-quality materials for hormone synthesis, ensuring the secretion of hypothalamic and pituitary gonadotropins, but also promote the maturation of the musculature and the development of the brain and cerebellum. They supplement essential amino acids, minerals, and trace elements for the cerebrum and cerebellum, reducing the synthesis of serotonin in the brain, thus decreasing attention, inducing sleep, and promoting the development and repair of the brain."
Millet-sized papules with fine scales on top,Lichen Scrofulosorum,"What are the treatment methods for Lichen Scrofulosorum? Treatment principles mainly involve actively improving the general health condition and enhancing the body's resistance. For systemic treatment drugs, refer to those for localized cutaneous tuberculosis. 

General treatments focus on attention to environmental hygiene and a reasonable lifestyle, including ample fresh air, sunlight, physical exercise, work and rest balance, and enhanced nutrition. A low-salt diet is advisable. Nutritive tonics may be given as appropriate. 

Local treatment principles are symptomatic, soothing, anti-inflammatory, and promote absorption, avoiding the use of highly irritating medications. 

Prognosis: The condition has a chronic course, may heal spontaneously, is prone to recurrence, and presents with mild subjective symptoms."
"Pea to millet-sized round or oval-shaped nodules, cysts",Cysticercosis,"What are the treatments for Cysticercosis?

(1) Treatment
For those with a small number of cysts, surgical removal is feasible. During removal, the cysts should be completely intact without rupture, or alcohol or hydrochloric praziquantel (also known as emetine) can be injected into the cysts. Praziquantel 20mg/kg, three times daily, for a total of 2-3 days.

(2) Prognosis
If it occurs in the deep tissues and muscles of the limbs, it can cause elephantiasis-like swelling of the affected limb. It can also affect the flexor side of the limbs, neck, breasts, and genital area. Eyes, brain, and internal organs such as the heart, liver, and lungs can all be involved."
"Sensory and motor disturbances in lower limbs, pain, severe cases may present with paralysis of the lower limbs and dysfunction of bladder and bowel control",Spina Bifida,"What are the treatment options for Spina Bifida? 
Pre-treatment considerations for Spina Bifida 
	Treatment 
	Surgical intervention is indicated for patients with tethered cord syndrome resulting from Spina Bifida. The aim of surgery is to remove osseous or fibrous septa between the split spinal cord, relieving pressure on the spinal cord and addressing factors contributing to spinal tethering. Pathological conditions such as lipoma and thickened filum terminale should also be surgically excised. 
	Prognosis 
	Surgical treatment can achieve favorable clinical outcomes, with a good prognosis."
"Obesity, Enlarged Breasts, Increased Vocal Pitch",Gynecomastia,"What are the treatment options for Gynecomastia?
    1. Etiological Treatment
        The cause of Gynecomastia is complex. After achieving an accurate diagnosis, treatment should be based on the underlying cause. Primary Gynecomastia during puberty often tends to resolve itself within about six months. In adults and seniors, primary Gynecomastia can sometimes resolve on its own, but part may require drug treatment. For secondary Gynecomastia, treatment should be targeted at the underlying cause. Once the primary pathological condition is cured, the enlarged breast often gradually recovers.
    2. Drug Treatment
        (1) Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators such as Tamoxifen.
        (2) Androgen Therapy can alleviate breast development in those with androgen deficiency, but it is not recommended in patients with normal levels of androgens as it may lead to the conversion of androgens into estrogens in the body, exacerbating breast development.
        (3) Aromatase inhibitors like Testolactone can inhibit the aromatization of androgens in the body, thereby reducing the production of estrogens.
    3. Surgical Treatment
        Aside from etiological and drug treatments, surgical intervention can be considered for Gynecomastia.
        (1) Indications include: a) Breast diameter greater than 4cm which does not reduce over time; b) Significant breast enlargement affecting aesthetics; c) Lack of significant therapeutic effect from conventional drug treatment; d) Patient concern over malignant transformation and psychological unease.
        (2) Surgical Methods include: a) Subcutaneous mastectomy (retaining the nipple and areola), suitable for younger patients; b) Simple mastectomy (not retaining the nipple and areola), usually for older patients. Excised specimens should be sent for pathological biopsy to confirm the diagnosis."
"Single, isolated nodule",Pilomatricoma,"The treatment options for pilomatricoma, a benign tumorous condition of the skin, primarily focus on surgical excision. Other methods include electrocautery and cryotherapy. Post-cryotherapy, the formation of blister-like changes in the skin is considered a normal reaction. In cases where a secondary skin infection is present, the application of topical or systemic antibiotics is recommended. Generally, as a benign condition, the prognosis for pilomatricoma is favourable."
"Ludwig's Angina, asphyxiation, fever with chills, hypotension, shock, cellulitis, edema, rough skin, tissue necrosis",Submandibular Space Infection,"Submandibular space infection treatment involves aggressive management due to the severity of local and systemic symptoms caused by both pyogenic and necrotizing fasciitis pathogens. The primary dangers are airway obstruction and systemic toxicity. Treatment protocols include extensive use of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics to control the infection's progression. Additionally, systemic support therapies such as hydration, blood transfusion, oxygen therapy, and maintenance of electrolyte balance are emphasized. Prompt incision and drainage (I&D) procedures are crucial. I&D generally involves an external approach, selecting areas of skin erythema with fluctuance for easier incisions. In cases where the swelling is diffuse or secondary edema is present, making abscess localization challenging, aspiration may first be performed to ascertain the abscess location before proceeding with incision. Extensive incisions may be necessary for widespread jaw involvement or respiratory distress, typically parallel to the mandible in a 'collar' or inverted 'T' shape incision. During surgery, it is essential to widely open the submandibular space and adequately separate the mylohyoid muscles to ensure efficient drainage of pus from all spaces. For infections caused by necrotizing fasciitis pathogens, once swelling extends to the neck and pre-pectoral area, and crepitus is detected, multiple incisions following the skin lines are made to ameliorate the anaerobic environment and enhance drainage. Wounds are frequently irrigated with 3% hydrogen peroxide or 1:5000 potassium permanganate solution, four to six times daily, with rubber tube drainage inserted into the wound."
"Microcirculation disorders, bleeding, hemolysis, acrocyanosis, cyanosis, oliguria, hypotension",Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC),"The treatment modalities for Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) include: 
(1) Treatment of the underlying cause and primary disease: The management of the primary disease is a fundamental measure in DIC treatment. This includes, for instance, rigorous infection control, removal of intrauterine contents such as a dead fetus or placenta, and anti-tumor therapy. Failure to control the primary disease often leads to treatment failure. 
(2) Supportive therapy: The coexisting conditions such as hypoxia, hypovolemia, hypotension, and shock, that could potentially impact the treatment outcomes should be thoroughly corrected to enhance therapeutic efficacy. 
(3) Heparin therapy: Opinions on the use of heparin in DIC have not been unified. Generally, treatment ought to be primarily aimed at the underlying cause. If the cause can be rapidly removed, heparin might not be mandatory or could be selectively used. In cases where DIC is suspected or only laboratory positive, indications should be strictly controlled. For patients with predominantly thrombotic symptoms confirming DIC, early use should be encouraged to prevent progression of the condition. Moderate doses of heparin are typically administered, with an intravenous injection of 50mg every 4-6 hours; or by continuous intravenous infusion, about 10mg per hour, totaling 200-300mg over 24 hours. Particularly at the beginning, the heparin dosage should not be excessive and adjusted based on treatment response. The coagulation time should be maintained at 20–30 minutes, with APTT at 1–2.5 times the normal value. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has a more stable anticoagulant effect and is considered superior by some. Recently, a regimen of low-dose heparin has been utilized, with subcutaneous injections of 2,500 units every 12 hours. The advantage of low-dose heparin treatment includes the absence of bleeding complications and the lack of need for laboratory monitoring. When heparin treatment is effective, the plasma fibrinogen content should recover within 1-3 days after treatment initiation, with a reduction in FDP. In cases of heparin overdose, protamine sulfate can be injected intravenously for neutralization, and fresh blood transfusion may be administered. 
(4) Antiplatelet agents: Commonly used antiplatelet drugs include dipyridamole, with an adult dosage of 400-800mg per day, taken orally in three divided doses, or 100-200mg dissolved in 100ml of dextrose solution for intravenous infusion, repeated every 4-6 hours. Aspirin is also used, with a daily dosage of 1.2-1.5g, taken orally in three divided doses. These may be used alone or in combination, suitable for mild cases or when the diagnosis is highly suspected but not yet confirmed. Additionally, administration of low molecular weight dextran by intravenous infusion, 500ml each time, can reduce blood viscosity and inhibit platelet aggregation, and may be used in conjunction with dipyridamole. 
(5) Antifibrinolytic agents: Typically used when secondary fibrinolysis is a major bleeding factor. Commonly used drugs include aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid, and aprotinin, with dosage reduction following improvement. 
(6) Supplementation of platelets or coagulation factors: If coagulation factors are significantly decreased, transfusions of blood, plasma, or fibrinogen preparations may be administered. Each gram can increase the blood concentration by 25-50mg%, with the hemostatic effect requiring fibrinogen levels to be raised above 100mg/dl. If platelets are reduced, concentrated platelet transfusions may be warranted. 
(7) Use of AT IV concentrates: Some have administered AT IV concentrates in conjunction with intravenous heparin infusion to enhance therapeutic efficacy, with dosages of 1500u/d, equivalent to the content in 1500ml of plasma."
"Left-sided abdominal pain, abdominal distension, dizziness, right upper quadrant pain",Splenomegaly,"The treatment of splenomegaly varies significantly due to the myriad of causes that can lead to an enlarged spleen. When encountering a patient with splenomegaly, it is crucial to integrate the patient's symptoms and signs to actively seek the primary disease, and treatment should undoubtedly be aimed at the primary disease. In cases where clinical manifestations include an enlarged spleen accompanied by a reduction in one or more types of blood cells, and bone marrow hematopoietic cells show proliferative characteristics, it can be referred to as hypersplenism. If spleen function is significantly increased, the treatment for the primary disease is not evidently effective, and the primary disease permits, splenectomy can be performed. However, the indications for splenectomy should be strictly adhered to: significant splenomegaly with compression symptoms; severe hemolytic anemia; severe neutropenia with frequent infections; significant thrombocytopenia, or associated with bleeding manifestations. After the removal of the spleen, platelets, neutrophils, and red blood cells can recover or approach normal levels. Post-splenectomy complications can include thrombosis, an increased risk of septicemia (as the spleen acts as a protective blood-filtering organ), and secondary thrombocytosis. Therefore, the decision to perform a splenectomy should be made with caution, especially in elderly or bedridden patients and in children with hypersplenism."
"Itching of the abdomen in pregnant women, severe itching, papules",Pruritic Urticarial Papules and Plaques of Pregnancy (PUPPP),"The treatment strategies for Pruritic Urticarial Papules and Plaques of Pregnancy (PUPPP) aim to alleviate itching, decelerate disease progression, and promote the resolution of rash. Initially, topical application of corticosteroids such as fluocinolone acetonide and triamcinolone acetonide cream is recommended, to be applied 5–6 times per day. Once the rash begins to subside, switching to weaker corticosteroid creams, calamine lotion, and oral antihistamines is advised. If necessary, oral prednisone may be administered. 

Prognostically, since the majority of PUPPP patients seek medical advice promptly to alleviate itch symptoms, there is limited knowledge on the natural progression of the condition. However, with appropriate treatment, symptoms generally alleviate within a few days and completely disappear postpartum. Unlike pemphigoid gestationis, PUPPP does not recur postpartum or after subsequent pregnancies or the introduction of oral contraceptives. Importantly, PUPPP does not increase fetal mortality or morbidity rates."
"Jaundice, Hypothyroidism, Convulsions, Miscarriage, Intracranial Hemorrhage, Paralysis, Diabetes, Polyhydramnios",Intellectual Disability,"What are the treatment methods for intellectual disability?
1. Etiological treatment: For confirmed causes such as chronic diseases, poisoning, long-term malnutrition, hearing and vision impairments, efforts should be made to remove the cause to allow partial or complete recovery of intellectual functions. Early diagnosis and treatment with thyroid hormone replacement therapy or special diet for phenylketonuria and other endocrine metabolic abnormalities can improve intellectual levels.
2. Training and Rehabilitation: Utilizing medical, social, educational, and vocational training measures tailored to the age and severity of ID. Train patients to achieve the highest possible level of intelligence. Organized institutional settings (e.g., nurseries and kindergartens) should provide comprehensive education and training as early as possible. Integrating children with ID with their non-disabled peers for care is more beneficial than separate care. Establishing special classes or schools to improve physical health, train in daily living skills, language functions, and basic cultural learning. Work medical stations can be established to train adolescents with ID in production skills and ensure employment opportunities. Specialized hospitals and convalescent homes (villages) for moderate to severe ID can also be established."
"Crusting, scaling, pustules, papules, itching, hair loss",Barber's Itch,"Therapeutic approaches for treating lupoid sycosis include systemic treatment with appropriate antibiotics, especially for cases involving seborrheic dermatitis which require active treatment. Physiotherapy or superficial X-ray irradiation may be considered. Local treatment involves hot compresses with a 1:5000 potassium permanganate solution applied 2-3 times a day, followed by antibiotic ointment or cleanser for subacute cases. Traditional Chinese Medicine suggests internal administration of Longdan Xiegan Pills or Zhizi Jinhua Pills and topical application of a mixture of 10% Realgar Jiedu Powder and Huanglian Ointment. Prognosis indicates that purulent follicular orifices heal leaving atrophic scars, leading to follicular destruction and hair loss. The disease course is slow, often chronic, and resistant to treatment."
Painless lump under the skin,Epidermoid Cyst,"The sole treatment method for an epidermoid cyst is surgical removal. During the procedure, a fusiform skin incision is made along the natural lines of the skin, especially when the duct opening is observed, and the cyst is excised along with the surrounding skin. Care must be taken during the separation as the cyst wall is thin and should be removed completely to prevent recurrence. If there are signs of inflammation such as redness, swelling, warmth, and pain prior to surgery, inflammation should be controlled first before proceeding with the excision.
Treatment Principles
1. Complete excision of the lump.
2. If there is concurrent infection, antimicrobial drugs may be chosen.
3. In cases of abscess formation, incision and drainage are required, and surgery to remove the cyst should be scheduled after the inflammation has subsided.
Principles of Medication
1. For early-stage, mild cases with concurrent infection, oral administration of Cefpiramide (Cefpiramide IV) is recommended.
2. For more severe infections, intramuscular administration of Cefuroxime is recommended."
"Nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, restlessness, somnolence, oliguria, anuria, coma",Renal Failure,"Treatment options for renal failure include: 
For acute renal failure: 
1. Treating the underlying causes, such as expanding blood volume to correct pre-renal factors, relieving post-renal obstruction factors. High-dose corticosteroids can be effective for severe rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis among others, while discontinuing medication immediately for allergic interstitial nephritis and administering anti-allergic medication. 
2. During the oliguric phase, fluid intake should be matched with output. 
3. Correction of hyperkalemia and acidosis. 
4. Early initiation of dialysis helps in dehydration, detoxification, correcting electrolyte imbalance, and acid-base imbalance, aiding patients in overcoming the challenges of the oliguric phase. Strict monitoring of water and electrolyte balance during the polyuric phase is crucial to prevent death due to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Nutritional support, rest, and avoiding nephrotoxic drugs are very important during the recovery phase. 
For chronic renal failure: 
1. Eliminating causative factors, symptomatic treatment, controlling infections, and correcting fluid, electrolyte imbalances, and acidosis. 
2. Non-dialysis treatment strategies include a low-protein, low-phosphorus diet to slow the progression of the disease. Protein intake adjustment based on renal function, with 50%-70% being high-quality protein (eggs, milk, lean meat). The daily caloric intake should be 146.3 kJ/kg/day, with a limited proportion of plant proteins, substituting rice and wheat with potato or corn starch. Supplementing with essential amino acids to increase protein synthesis, improve nutritional status and immunity depleted by long-term low-protein diet, and reduce serum phosphorus. Oral intake of rhubarb or enema decoction can decrease blood urea nitrogen (Bun) in mild uremia. Oral adsorbents like oxidized starch can bind intestinal urea nitrogen or amine for excretion, lowering Bun. Oral mannitol can also reduce Bun and serum creatinine (Scr) through excretion, but is not recommended for severe cases. 
3. Administering erythropoietin subcutaneously or intravenously thrice a week, accompanied by iron supplementation to rapidly correct anemia. 
4. Using calcium phosphate binders like calcium carbonate or traditional Chinese medicine formula 'Kidney and Bone Capsules' to correct hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, along with vitamin D3 to mitigate secondary hyperparathyroidism-related bone disease."

"Recurrent infections, abnormal appetite, anorexia, malnutrition, obstructive jaundice, biliary colic, impaired memory, insomnia, listlessness, epigastric hidden pain, fullness after meals, fatigue",Clonorchiasis,"Treatment options for Clonorchiasis include: 
Prevention: Clonorchiasis is caused by the ingestion of raw or undercooked freshwater fish or shrimp infected with Clonorchis sinensis metacercariae. Key preventative measures involve interrupting the transmission routes, particularly by controlling oral infection. Additionally, managing infection sources is crucial. 
1. Measures against the infection sources:
(a) Survey and treat infection sources: In endemic areas, it is essential to enhance surveys, initially utilizing skin tests for screening, followed by stool examination for those who test positive. All individuals with fecal examination positive for eggs should be treated with medication.
(b) Management of animal infection sources: Feeding cats, dogs, pigs, etc., with raw fish, shrimp, or their viscera should be avoided to prevent infections. The disposal of these animals' feces needs to be managed to prevent fecal matter from entering ditches and fishponds. Infected livestock should be dewormed if possible. Wild animal definitive hosts may be culled as appropriate.
2. Measures against the transmission routes:
(a) Avoid eating uncooked fish and shrimp: Enhance health education in endemic areas to ensure the inhabitants are well informed about the disease's risks and transmission routes. Not consuming uncooked fish or shrimp is the most effective prevention measure. Experiments demonstrate that metacercariae in 1mm thick fish meat placed into water at 98°C will die within 1 second, and at 70°C, within 5 seconds; if the fish meat is 2-3mm thick, at 70°C, they die within 8 seconds. Hence, thicker fish requires longer cooking times. Metacercariae are relatively resistant to condiments; they die after 2 hours in vinegar (approx. 3.36% acetic acid) and after 5 hours in soy sauce (19.3% sodium chloride). Therefore, uncooked fish meat could facilitate disease transmission. It is important to use separate utensils for raw and cooked food in the kitchen. Children should be educated not to eat grilled, baked, or raw dried fish.
(b) Improve feces management: Prevent untreated feces from being disposed of in fishponds. Toilets should not be built above fishponds, nor should untreated feces be used as fish feed. The epidemiological links of clonorchiasis are well understood; controlling the transmission routes and sources of infection can prevent the spread of the disease."
"Constipation, abdominal mass, anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, sticky stool, bloody stool with blood mixed with feces, skin metastasis, melena, extensive pelvic infiltration, and dissemination.",Colorectal Cancer,"Treatment options for colorectal cancer include:

1. Surgical Treatment
  - The main comprehensive treatment strategy for colorectal cancer involves surgical resection followed by regional lymph node dissection, tailoring the radical resection extent and method according to the tumor’s location for stages I, II, and III patients. For stage IV patients, if intestinal obstruction or severe intestinal bleeding occurs, radical surgery is not performed initially; a palliative resection might be done instead to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.
  - The basis for treating rectal cancer is surgery, which can be more challenging than colon surgery. Common surgical methods include: transanal excision (for very early stage near anal margin), total mesorectal excision, low anterior resection, and abdominoperineal resection with sphincter management. For stage II and III rectal cancer, preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy are recommended to reduce tumor size and stage, followed by definitive surgical treatment.

2. Comprehensive Treatment
  - The standard treatment for stage III colorectal cancer and some high-risk stage II patients currently includes adjuvant chemotherapy with a combination of oxaliplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (5-fluorouracil or capecitabine), typically over 6 months.
  - Treatment for stage IV colorectal cancer primarily involves a comprehensive strategy with chemotherapy, including drugs like 5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bevacizumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab. Common chemotherapy regimens include FOLFOX, XELOX, and FOLFIRI, optionally combined with targeted therapy drugs as appropriate.

3. Radiation Therapy
  - Presently, an excellent approach involves combined surgical and radiation therapy treatments, encompassing preoperative, intraoperative, postoperative, and 'sandwich' radiotherapy, each with unique advantages. For late-stage rectal cancer, local tumor infiltration, or patients not suitable for surgery, palliative radiation therapy is applied to alleviate symptoms and reduce pain."
"Spina bifida, spinal curvature, intervertebral space changes, dural sac herniation, spinal cord compression, bamboo spine, scoliosis, infantile spinal curvatures, spinal destruction, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, thoracic or lumbar spinal injury, angular spinal deformities",Spina Bifida,"What are the treatment options for Spina Bifida? 
1. Asymptomatic occult spina bifida does not require treatment. 
2. Surgical treatment: 
    (1) If the cyst wall is very thin, the cystic cavity is expanding rapidly, and there is a risk of rupture or there already is a rupture without infection, surgery should be performed as soon as possible. 
    (2) If the cyst wall is thicker, the mass is smaller, and lower limb mobility is good, surgery can be considered when the infant is slightly older and can tolerate the procedure. 
    (3) If simple cyst excision was performed during infancy but there are still urinary and lower limb functional disturbances, and the local skin remains normal, further surgery should be sought. 
    (4) Cyst wall rupture with infection, early-onset severe neurological dysfunction, accompanied by hydrocephalus and significant intellectual impairment are contraindications for surgery. 
   The general principle of surgery involves tumor excision, neural release, spinal decompression, reinsertion of herniated neural tissue into the spinal canal, repairing soft tissue defects, and avoiding prolonged traction on neural tissues that could exacerbate symptoms. Post-surgery, dressing should be meticulous, and within 2-3 days after surgery and suture removal, the patient should be placed in a prone or lateral position to prevent urine and feces from soaking and contaminating the incision."
"Paralysis, quadriplegia, mild paralysis, spastic diplegic gait, poor suckling, loss of sucking reflex, paraplegia, limb paralysis, newborn bradykinesia, bilateral bradykinesia, kernicterus, jaundice",Cerebral Palsy,"What are the treatment options for Cerebral Palsy? 
Current research on early rehabilitation screening and intervention for brain damage in children with cerebral palsy has made some in-depth studies. Early screening, diagnosis, and intervention for children at high risk of cerebral palsy are crucial primary prevention measures to reduce disability and improve the quality of life for affected children. Intervention involves an analysis and discussion of educational strategies from various perspectives, including society, family, and the individual. It is essential to view the organism as a whole or a system and to explore this in combination with typical cases. For instance, play is an instinct for infants and a form of life movement. Training can utilize toys, commonly used household items, or homemade toys to create a rich and diverse external environment and provide stimulation through food, toys, and household chores. This enrichment enables children to experience a vibrant external environment, making them more agile and adaptable. 

Traditional Chinese medicine treatment, surgical treatment, and drug treatment with intramuscular Botulinum Toxin A (BTXA) injections can be employed, providing favorable conditions for the rehabilitation training of children with spastic CP."
"Abdominal distension, borborygmi, abdominal tenderness, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, colonic distention, high fever",Ischemic Colitis,"Treatment options for Ischemic Colitis include: 
1. Treatment Principles: Fasting and oxygen supplementation at medium to high flow rates are essential; actively eliminating causes and treating comorbidities; expanding blood volume, improving microcirculation, and alleviating mucosal ischemia; administering antibiotics; improving overall condition, combating shock, and providing fluids and correcting heart failure; treating comorbidities and complications; and surgical intervention when necessary. Early supportive care during the pathological stage, including fasting, replenishing blood volume, and maintaining electrolyte balance and cardiac output. Antibiotics may be used to prevent infection. Patients with severe conditions, such as intestinal perforation or signs of peritonitis, should undergo exploratory laparotomy promptly. 

2. Treatment Methods: 
(a) Conservative Management: Most non-gangrenous intramural lesions tend to be self-limiting and can gradually resolve. Even if some patients develop colonic strictures, most are incomplete intestinal obstructions that can be alleviated through conservative treatment. 
(b) Surgical Treatment: The mortality of gangrenous ischemic colitis largely depends on the timeliness of diagnosis and surgical intervention, the patient's overall condition, and the occurrence of complications. A high mortality rate is observed in cases with serious complications such as respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure, and persistent infections. Surgical intervention is mostly limited to patients with gangrenous ischemic colitis; prompt surgery is recommended upon diagnosis. For patients with significant colonic distention from gangrenous ischemic colitis, total colectomy should be considered. Surgical treatment should also be considered for patients whose conditions do not significantly improve after more than two weeks of aggressive conservative management. Most cases of colonic stricture caused by ischemic colitis are incomplete intestinal obstructions, thus avoiding the need for surgery. However, patients with symptoms of chronic colonic obstruction that cannot be alleviated through conservative treatment or are difficult to distinguish from colonic malignancy should undergo surgery. This involves the resection of the narrowed intestinal segment, primary anastomosis to restore continuity of the bowel, and pathological examination of the resected tissue."
"Head shaking, neck turning, continuous twitching of a specific part of the body or face, and calf muscle spasm after walking",Tourette Syndrome,"The treatment options for Tourette Syndrome vary based on the severity of the condition. For those whose daily life and learning are significantly affected by severe symptoms, pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment approach, combined with psychotherapy. If the condition is caused by psychological factors, it is imperative to actively eliminate these factors. 
1. Pharmacotherapy 
Pimozide, with an effectiveness rate of 60%–90%, is administered once or twice daily. The dose is observed for 3 to 7 days for side effects and then increased if no significant adverse effects are observed. Dosage adjustments should be made based on therapeutic outcomes and side reactions. The drug primarily has sedative and extrapyramidal side effects. 
Tetrabenazine shows an effectiveness rate of 76%–87%, characterized by fewer extrapyramidal side reactions and is suitable for patients over 7 years of age. It is usually taken 2 to 3 times daily. Common side effects include drowsiness, fatigue, dizziness, gastrointestinal discomfort, excitement, insomnia, etc. 
Clonidine can improve Tourette's symptoms, with an effectiveness rate of 50%–86%. This medication also ameliorates attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and is the drug of choice for those with co-occurring ADHD or those who develop Tourette's symptoms following the use of central stimulants for ADHD. It is mainly available as a transdermal patch in China, with side effects including drowsiness, hypotension, dizziness, and dry mouth. 
Risperidone has been reported to be effective in treating this disorder. It primarily has sedative and extrapyramidal side effects. 
2. Psychotherapy 
This mainly involves psychological supportive therapy, cognitive therapy, and behavioral therapy. The goals of psychological support and cognitive therapy are to adjust the family system, educate patients and their families about the nature of the disorder and the reasons for symptom fluctuation, eliminate negative factors in school and home environments that may contribute to or maintain symptoms, alleviate anxiety and depression resulting from Tourette's symptoms, and improve social functioning. Evidence supports that habit reversal training and other behavioral therapies have a positive effect on correcting Tourette's symptoms. 
3. Other treatments 
For refractory cases ineffective with multiple drug therapies, options like Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), or neurosurgical stereotactic surgery, such as pallidotomy, can be considered. However, the consensus among experts in this field is that DBS treatment is still in the early stage of research and requires well-designed controlled studies to further verify its efficacy and safety. It is only applicable to adult patients, those with difficult-to-treat conditions, and patients significantly affected. It is not recommended for use in children."
"Anemia, lack of appetite, abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, malnutrition, dizziness, fatigue, insomnia",Trichuriasis,"The treatment for trichuriasis primarily involves the use of anthelmintic drugs, similar to those used for hookworm infections. Common choices include albendazole, mebendazole, and thiabendazole. The method of administration, dosage, treatment duration, and adverse reactions are similar to those for hookworm disease. Thiabendazole, or thiophanate-methyl, is administered at a dosage of 10-20 mg/kg per day, either as a single dose or over two consecutive days. For patients with anemia, iron supplementation should be provided."
"Fever, bloody pus stools, diarrhea, abdominal pain, signs of meningeal irritation, reflex vomiting",Campylobacter Enteritis,"Treatment options for Campylobacter Enteritis include: 
1. General Treatment: Gastrointestinal isolation is necessary, with thorough disinfection of the patient’s feces. The isolation period starts from the onset until the stool culture turns negative. Symptomatic treatment should be provided for fever, severe abdominal pain, and diarrhea, along with bed rest. A diet of easily digestible semi-liquid food is recommended, and fluid replenishment is necessary when needed. 
2. Etiological Treatment: Campylobacter is sensitive to gentamicin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, kanamycin, neomycin, and lincomycin, but resistant to penicillin and cephalosporins. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, such as ofloxacin, also show good efficacy, but may affect bone development in young children. Gentamicin is the first choice for bacterial endocarditis, while chloramphenicol is preferred for meningitis. For severe infections, the treatment duration should be extended to 3-4 weeks to prevent recurrence."
"Dry cough, exertional dyspnea, weight loss, fatigue, fever, night sweats, and decreased appetite",Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH),"What are the treatment methods for Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis?

1. Smoking cessation: Smoking cessation is the primary treatment intervention. 50% to 75% of patients experience stabilization or improvement in their condition 6 to 24 months after quitting smoking, with symptom relief and complete or partial resolution of radiographic lesions. Additionally, quitting smoking reduces the risk of lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cardiovascular diseases.

2. Glucocorticoids: For patients with systemic symptoms, worsening radiographic or pulmonary function, empirical use of glucocorticoids is advised. The initial dosage of prednisone is 0.5 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg per day, gradually tapered over a period of 6 to 12 months. However, the efficacy of glucocorticoids has not been conclusively proven.

3. Cytotoxic drugs: Cytotoxic drugs, such as vinblastine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cladribine, may be used in patients who do not respond to quitting smoking or steroid therapy and have multi-organ involvement. The effectiveness of cytotoxic drugs remains unclear.

4. Lung transplantation: For end-stage PLCH patients with severe respiratory failure or pulmonary hypertension, lung transplantation should be considered. Patients must quit smoking before the transplantation; if the patient resumes smoking after the transplantation, the transplanted lungs can still develop LCH again."
"Mucoid secretions, significant increase in sweat production",Syringoma,"The etiology of syringoma is not clearly understood, and the condition is quite rare. It may be related to environmental, genetic, dietary factors, as well as emotional states and nutrition during pregnancy. Since the cause of the disease is not clear, it is not possible to treat based on etiology. The main treatment methods for syringoma include surgical excision and laser therapy, both of which can improve symptoms of hyperhidrosis. For cases that involve sweat gland infections, concurrent anti-infection treatment should be administrated."
"Hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly, Ascites, Jaundice",Budd-Chiari Syndrome,"The treatment modalities for Budd-Chiari Syndrome include: Interventional Treatment: Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA), also known as balloon angioplasty, has emerged as a relatively safe, simple, minimally invasive method with nearly zero operative mortality and no significant contraindications. Initially successful in treating membranous obstruction of the inferior vena cava by Eguchi, its advantages and efficacy have made it the preferred treatment for patients with membranous obstruction. The procedure, not complex, is performed following confirmation of stenosis or occlusion via inferior vena cavography. In case of complete obstruction, a stiff catheter or a valvulotome is used to perforate the septum, followed by dilatation at the stenotic site with balloons of increasing diameters, using 30% Hypaque as a filling and pressurizing agent. Post-dilatation venography and pressure measurements are utilized to assess treatment effectiveness. Some recent advances include the use of lasers to penetrate the stenotic ring before balloon dilatation. To prevent recurrence, Percutaneous Transluminal Stent Angioplasty (PTS), a method involving the placement of expandable metallic stents to establish a venous passageway, has gained popularity due to its high efficacy and low recurrence rates. Though initially less reported in domestic literature, its adoption has increased over the years, showing a tendency to surpass PTA. Surgical Treatment: Various surgical methods have been documented, each with a limited number of reported cases, making it challenging to compare their long-term efficacies. The choice of surgery depends on the patient's condition, including bleeding, presence of ascites, and tolerance for surgery. Techniques include: Membrane fragmentation through the right atrial approach, shunting procedures to reduce portal or inferior vena cava pressure, and spleen-lung fixation for patients with high portal pressure, ascites, and esophagogastric varices, a method initially introduced by Akita in 1962 for portal hypertension and then in 1964 for BCS, proven to be effective, simple, safe, and without embolism complications. Liver transplantation may be considered in cases of severe liver damage and liver failure, representing an effective life-saving method but requiring high technical expertise, significant costs, timely liver donors, and comprehensive post-operative care including anti-rejection therapy. Tissue resection of lesions might also be a superior treatment method."
"Fever, lung infection, difficulty breathing, keratitis, fungemia, cough, productive cough, hemoptysis",Aspergillosis,"The treatment methods for Aspergillosis include: 
1. Treating the primary disease and enhancing the host's immune function. 
2. Systemic antifungal therapy with agents such as potassium iodide, amphotericin B, flucytosine (5-FC), ketoconazole, miconazole, and itraconazole. 
3. For cases with endocarditis, it is necessary to excise the infected cardiac valve lesions and add amphotericin B; for fungal keratitis, antibiotics and corticosteroids should be discontinued, with both systemic and local application of antifungal medications."
"Night sweats, nausea, fatigue, lung infections, diplopia, abdominal masses, osteomyelitis, bone destruction",Actinomycosis,"Treatment options for actinomycosis include: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment methods emphasize the use of formulas that clear heat, detoxify, soften hard masses, break up stagnation, and promote the discharge of pus, such as modified Xiaoyang Drink. Externally applied Huoyang medicated fumigation targets the sinus tracts, followed by application of purple sore ointment to promote decay removal, and surface healing. Western medicine treatment approaches focus on the slow progression of the disease, where early diagnosis significantly impacts prognosis. The cervicofacial form has the best prognosis, followed by thoracic, abdominal, and generalized forms, respectively. The prognosis worsens if the central nervous system is involved, depending on the degree of pelvic infection and the duration of illness before diagnosis. Pharmacotherapy mainly involves antibiotics and sulfonamides. Penicillin is the antibiotic of choice, with dosages and duration depending on the severity of the condition; daily intravenous administration (1～20)×106u. High dosage and extended application are key to a cure. Intravenous drip of penicillin for 7～10 days is crucial for rapid symptom control, followed by oral penicillin maintenance for 30～45 days for complete recovery. Other antibiotics like erythromycin, tetracycline, clindamycin, cephalosporins, and rifampin are used when penicillin is contraindicated due to allergies, inefficacy, or intolerance. Sulfonamide compounds are formulated from sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), sulfadiazine (SD), and trimethoprim (TMP). Polyene and azole antifungal agents are ineffective against actinomycosis. Surgical treatment involves excision or incision and drainage of all superficial lesions and abscesses. Rib and lung lesions should be thoroughly removed; severe cases may require lobectomy. Medication should commence 30～45 days before surgical lesion removal and drainage or incision for pus discharge, continuing for 12～18 months post-surgery. Oral penicillin may be administered at a dose of 125～500mg every 6～8 hours, with mild cases requiring at least 2 months of continuous medication. To enhance penicillin penetration into the lesion, 10% potassium iodide solution, 10～20ml orally three times a day, may be added. For improved efficacy, penicillin can be combined with sulfonamide drugs, 1g orally per day. X-ray therapy may serve as an adjunct for cervical and facial superficial actinomycosis lesions. Until the 1970s, potassium iodide and radiation therapy were used. Supportive care is crucial for patients with severe, widespread infections, focusing on nutrition supplementation. The prognosis of actinomycosis has generally improved with the extensive use of antibiotics, especially with early diagnosis and adequate, timely treatment regimens. The cervicofacial type carries a good prognosis, while adequate treatment of other types can prevent deformities and other sequelae. With the introduction of antibiotics in treating actinomycosis, especially for severe and disseminated cases, the prognosis has significantly improved. High cure rates are achievable, and deformities or death caused by the disease have become uncommon."
"Difficulty in retracting the foreskin, difficulty urinating, and urinary retention",Phimosis,"What are the treatment options for phimosis?
Circumcision is recommended in patients with prolonged foreskin to prevent complications. For those with a non-inflammatory condition of excessive foreskin, regular retraction of the foreskin for cleaning may suffice without the need for surgical intervention.
Pre-marital circumcision is advocated for individuals with phimosis or excessive foreskin. It is advisable to initiate sexual activity only after undergoing this treatment. For those who have not undergone this procedure, genital hygiene is crucial before and after intercourse to prevent infections. Additionally, maintaining lubrication in the genital area and avoiding vigorous movements during sexual activity can help prevent paraphimosis or frenulum tear."
"Mammary gland hyperplasia, nipple discharge, nipple pruritus",Galactorrhea,"The treatment options for galactorrhea vary. For prolactinomas with hyperprolactinemia, treatment approaches are debated when prolactin (PRL) levels are <100ng/ml and there's a normal CT or MRI scan, or only a microadenoma is present; treatment with bromocriptine or follow-up monitoring may be utilized. Bromocriptine treatment is also recommended for patients without tumors, as hyperprolactinemia in women often leads to hypoestrogenism, potentially increasing the risk of osteoporosis. Bromocriptine is particularly advised for patients desiring pregnancy and those distressed by nipple discharge. Since less than 5% of microadenoma patients experience significant tumor growth, patients with low estrogen may receive exogenous estrogen therapy. All patients with hyperprolactinemia should undergo regular baseline PRL measurement and sella turcica radiography, though the scope of monitoring is subject to debate. Evaluations should occur at least every four months, with CT or MRI screenings annually for at least two years. If baseline PRL levels do not increase, the frequency of radiographic assessment may be reduced. 
For patients with macroadenomas, treatment typically involves bromocriptine or surgery following a comprehensive pituitary function test, and consultation with endocrinologists, neurosurgeons, and radiation therapy specialists. Bromocriptine is often preferred as the initial treatment by most endocrinologists. If PRL levels decrease and symptoms and signs of tumor compression disappear, further treatment may not be necessary. Bromocriptine is also commonly used preoperatively to reduce tumor size. Evidence suggests that bromocriptine alone is sufficient for patients with macroadenomas smaller than 2cm in diameter and elevated PRL levels. 
Radiation therapy is reserved only for those who fail other treatments and demonstrate progressive disease. The main concern with radiation therapy is the potential for hypopituitarism years after treatment. Post-treatment of macroadenomas requires lifelong endocrine function monitoring (at least annually) and sella turcica evaluation."
"Tea-brown patches in a butterfly distribution on the bridge of the nose, cheeks, and forehead",Melasma,"What are the treatment options for melasma? 
 1. Diet therapy: Preventing and treating melasma primarily involves vitamin supplementation. Consuming foods rich in Vitamin C such as tomatoes, kiwis, strawberries, and dairy products rich in Vitamin B6 is very effective. 
 2. Cold and hot water washing: Persistently washing the spotted areas on the face with alternating cold and hot water can promote blood circulation in the respective areas, accelerating the breakdown of melanin. 
 3. Homemade herbal masks: Grind the leaves of the persimmon tree into a powder, take 30 grams, and mix thoroughly with 30 grams of white petroleum jelly to make a topical ointment. Apply it to spotted areas before bed, wash it off the next morning. Continuous application for half a month to one month is required for effectiveness. Alternatively, use two eggs and 30 grams of Poria cocos powder, mix the egg whites with the Poria cocos powder, add sufficient water to make it into a paste, apply it on the face for 20 minutes, then wash off with clean water. 
 For more specialized removal techniques, the following methods can be considered: 
 1. Laser Treatment: Remove pigmentation with advanced laser equipment, yielding significant and safe results. Opting for laser treatments at professional beauty institutions guarantees safe and effective pigmentation removal. 
 2. Herbal Remedies: Following the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine, take herbal preparations with corresponding effects and additionally apply herbal masks, curing pigmentation from the inside out. This method is more conservative and has limited effectiveness but is the safest. 
 3. Biological Treatments: Oral, injectable, or topical use of biological preparations with depigmentation effects, achieving both symptomatic and root cause treatment of pigmentation."
"Presents with intellectual decline, memory disorders, epileptic seizures, limb weakness, numbness, and skin pigmentation spots, which appear light brown, dark brown, or coffee-colored",Neurofibromatosis,"What are the treatment options for Neurofibromatosis? 

Treatment: Currently, there is no specific cure for Neurofibromatosis. Surgical excision is the only effective treatment method for this disease. Radiotherapy may be applicable for some patients, and antiepileptic drugs can be used for those experiencing epileptic seizures. Other measures mainly involve symptomatic treatment. 
1. Surgical Excision: Surgical removal is the sole treatment strategy, aimed at alleviating symptoms and reducing tumor volume. Intracranial and spinal canal tumors such as acoustic neuromas and optic nerve gliomas can be surgically treated. Complete excision within the cyst is not as straightforward as with schwannomas due to unclear cyst walls and a high recurrence rate, whereas marginal excision has a lower recurrence rate and extensive excision guarantees treatment with a very low recurrence rate. Extensive or marginal excision is possible unless the tumor is located on a major nerve trunk, as such excision may cause nerve damage leading to disability. In such cases, intra-cystic excision is still performed, though recurrence can involve the nerve, making subsequent intra-cystic excision challenging. Generally, radiotherapy is avoided due to potential nerve damage. 
Small and localized tumors should be completely excised in one surgery. Large, extensive, or multiple tumors are usually difficult to remove completely and cannot be cured; staged excision may be considered. Priority is given to excising parts that damage appearance, impede function, or are suspected of malignant transformation. The amount of tissue to be removed in staged excision should be estimated to avoid complications such as edge necrosis or wound dehiscence due to excessive removal. Most tumor excisions result in soft tissue defects, which should be repaired using microsurgical techniques for large muscle flap transplantation. 
2. Flap Transplantation: Includes pedicled flap transplantation, requiring the flap to contain 1-2 vessels (artery and vein) to ensure flap survival. Flap transplantation is divided into flat flap transplantation and tubular flap (skin tube) transplantation, the latter mainly used in reconstructive surgery. 
(1) Creation of a flat flap: Also known as a simple flap or open flap, transplanted in a flat form, usually requires only one pedicle, though sometimes two. The ratio of flap length to width generally does not exceed 1.5:1, except in the well-vascularized head and face area, where the ratio can reach 3-4:1. In areas with poor circulation like the lower leg, the ratio must be 1:1 to avoid vascular complications affecting flap survival. The flap size can be designed according to the direction of vessels, with the pedicle directed towards the proximal end of the vessel. The donor site can be directly sutured or repaired with a medium-thick skin graft. 
(2) Flap transplantation methods: 
	Local rotation method: Uses part of the normal skin tissue around the defect to create a flap, which is then rotated to cover the defect and repair the wound surface. The design of the rotating flap should have a longer diameter than the wound surface to avoid excessive tension after suturing, which can cause the cut to split and affect blood supply to the flap. Creases may appear near the defect side of the pedicle due to rotation, more noticeable with larger angles. However, these creases should not be immediately excised as it could narrow the pedicle and cause vascular complications or necrosis. The donor site of the flap can be directly sutured or repaired with a skin graft. 
	Local advancement method: Utilizes the extensibility of the skin to form a flap around the wound and advances the flap towards the wound in a perpendicular direction for repair. The donor site can be slightly separated and pulled together with a 'Y' suture after a 'V' incision. Alternatively, a 'Y' incision can be made and a 'V' suture used for repair. 
	Local transposition method: For wounds that cannot be directly sutured and are relatively wide, a tension-reducing incision is made at an appropriate distance from the wound. A subcutaneous dissection is performed from the incision towards the wound to form a bilobed flat flap, which is then transposed to repair the wound. This method is commonly used to repair longitudinal fusiform skin defects and exposed bone tissue on the anterior tibia, with a recommended length to width ratio of 1.5:1 for the flap. The donor site is repaired with a medium-thick skin graft. 
	Distant transfer method: The flap donor site is located far from the defect area, such as using the contralateral lower leg flap to repair the anterior tibial area. Finger wounds can be repaired with a contralateral chest wall flap. 
3. Precautions: 
(1) Patients with neurofibromatosis may sometimes have poor tolerance to surgery, which requires special attention. 
(2) Large tumors on limbs can frequently ulcerate, leading to infection and pus formation, becoming an indication for eventual amputation. 
(3) After flap transplantation surgery, proper bandaging and fixation are essential to minimize deformation and movement of the recipient tissue, ensuring close adherence of the transplanted flap to the wound surface. 
4. Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment: The principles of treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine should focus on balancing Qi and blood, unblocking meridians, and softening and resolving internal masses. 
Prescribed formula includes Salvia miltiorrhiza 15g, Spatholobus suberectus 30g, Paeonia lactiflora 15g, Carthamus tinctorius 15g, Magnolia officinalis 10g, Citrus reticulata 'Chachi' 10g, Sinapis alba 10g, Citrus reticulata 10g, Luffa cylindrica 10g, Bombyx mori 10g, Fritillaria thunbergii 10g. 
Prognosis: Generally, the prognosis is good, with few cases undergoing malignant transformation. Prognosis is poor for those with concurrent intracranial meningiomas, gliomas, peripheral nerve sarcomas, and other malignant tumors. The disease typically progresses slowly, but can accelerate during puberty or pregnancy, with a malignancy rate of about 7%."
